They produce tokens we don't need, incentivize marketing and speculation over development, and neglect end-user utility.", "text": "ICOs incentivize developers to increase coin value, but that's not the same thing as producing useful tools or effective dapps. Thus, the coins keep coming, but they generally don't add any real utility.\n\nMakerDAO ~~and EtherDelta are~~ is the only project I can think of that provide real use-cases *today* and used an ICO to get there. When I asked the community for more examples, [the response was not encouraging](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/80bvc0/what_are_some_useful_dapps_that_work_today_are/).\n\nOn the other hand, consider dapps like CryptoKitties, Gitcoin, and Toastycoin, all of which launched without an ICO.\n\n- CryptoKitties truly broke new ground, giving every Ethereum user access to a genre of entertainment we don't even have a name for yet--some bizarre marriage of day-trading and beanie babies. For the first time, I was able to show people in the real world a working dapp that was *fun*, to the point where they downloaded MetaMask and put some ether on it. That's a pretty big deal.\n\n- Gitcoin has created a two-sided market out of nowhere, allowing developers and freelancers in OSS to accelerate projects and make money, respectively. Again, Ethereum users now have access to a new, useful economic tool that didn't exist before. It represents a huge step forward in solving the funding problem of open source development.\n\n- Toastycoin (full disclosure: my project) used novel game theory to outsource arbitrary tasks to reliable strangers while dissuading scammers, all automatically. The Ethereum ecosystem now has access to a generalized, unscammable task outsourcing mechanism, which has been proven to work and is unhindered by licensing restrictions.\n\nHow many \"game coin\" ICOs have we seen? And yet it was CryptoKitties alone that was so fun it clogged Ethereum *for a week*. How many ICOs talk about service marketplaces? And yet gitcoin is quietly listing [25 open tasks](https://gitcoin.co/explorer?q=) just waiting for developers to claim them (edit: and over 100 finished tasks!), and Toastycoin generalizes the idea further to apply to any small task one human could perform for another.\n\nEven better: none of these products require the user to go buy some shit coin on some random exchange they've never heard of. They just need ether and MetaMask, and they've got virtual kitties. Boom.\n\nICOs are not effective vehicles for innovation, and don't deserve the focus we've been giving them. This argument can be made historically, it can be made game-theoretically, and it can be made simply by comparing the rate of ICOs (astonishing) with the rate of utility growth they bring (paltry).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/86i8c7/icos_are_an_illusion_of_progress_they_produce/", "author": "coinop-logan", "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/86i8c7/icos_are_an_illusion_of_progress_they_produce/"}, "86ihdp": {"id": "86ihdp", "subreddit": "r/ethereum", "created_utc": 1521785084.0, "title": "[LIVE] Ethereum Core Devs Meeting #35 [03/23/18] (Starts 10AM EST)", "text": "", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHK6xhuSyUU", "author": "Souptacular", "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/86ihdp/live_ethereum_core_devs_meeting_35_032318_starts/"}, "86ihve": {"id": "86ihve", "subreddit": "r/ethtrader", "created_utc": 1521785248.0, "title": "Earn free BCHAR Token", "text": "You can earn free bchar token.

It was a peaceful, eye opening experience that taught me a lot. This event was essential to understanding their electoral process, and I could see many ways in which DID, and our blockchain technology, could potentially be of use.\n\nFirstly, the act of attending the polling station itself. There are no postal ballots or absentee ballots so if you physically cannot attend -whether you are out of the country at that time, elderly or infirm, or are fearful of venturing out due to intimidation tactics\u200a\u2014\u200athat means you DO NOT vote.\n\nSecondly, once you do arrive at the polling station, they must check your identity against their list of registered voters using your voter registration card. This registration card has been procured months earlier using physical evidence to verify your identity. Although having done this part earlier does speed the process somewhat, it still takes time.\n\nThirdly, the voting itself; your finger is dipped in ink and used to mark which candidate you are voting for. The ink is semi-permanent, and therefore extraordinarily difficult to wash off; the ink stain usually lasts several days. This is to ensure that each person can only vote once. Whilst somewhat effective, there are ways to remove the stain(using petrol for example) rendering this method less than perfect.\n\nLastly, the actual counting of the votes is arduous. Whilst every effort is made to ensure there is no falsifying numbers, there is always room for human error. Not to mention, the process is extremely time consuming as each ballot is counted and checked against the total number of ballots issued. Ballot boxes must be unlocked, serial numbers read out, then emptied and shown to be empty. Ballots are then sorted into piles according to the eligibility and the political party, and then at last begins the counting of each ballot aloud and holding each one up to ensure observers like me can verify the vote. Once every ballot is counted, the numbers are then entered into a finalised document that is signed by all present. Needless to say, it is a long, tedious process that must be completed in full to ensure no miscounts or inappropriate behaviour. All told, this part of the election took over 5 hours. Once the ballots from this particular polling station have been counted, they are sent to the NEC offices to be counted with all the other votes in the country.\n\nAnd then, of course, there is the lengthy process of counting each vote from EVERY polling station in the country, meaning an accurate result will not be announced for days, or even weeks in some instances.\n\nHow can DID help? Let\u2019s go back and envision the process using our technology.\n\nFirstly\u200a\u2014\u200athere is no need to physically attend the polling station. Once your voter registration is entered onto the blockchain, you can vote from anywhere you have internet access. This ensures EVERYONE can vote. Whether you are out of town, elderly, or injured there is no need to worry about not being able to vote\u200a\u2014\u200aOR\u200a\u2014\u200ayour postal or absentee ballot not making it on time. This also eliminates any intimidation tactics, which have been employed previously and include anything from kidnap to even rape, violence, and bribery. With DID software, citizens can vote by simply scanning a QR code from the comfort of their homes. This will undoubtedly increase the number of voters, allowing for a more thorough representation of the population.\n\nThis method could also render the polling station obsolete. Imagine no more queuing for hours to gain entrance and then queuing again to check your voter card against the registration list, and queuing one final time to cast your actual vote. The entire process is made extremely efficient by eliminating the paper ballot. The blockchain ensures that the \u201cone man, one vote\u201d ethos is firmly upheld due to its immutable nature. In addition, since the process is now digitalized, there is no need to ink your finger or manually count the votes and risk human error or interference. Votes are uploaded instantly to tamper proof smart contracts on the blockchain (authenticated with our BOCA technology) and this eliminates any opportunity for human error, protects against fraud, bribery, corruption, and the software can report the results on the same day.\n\nIn a country with a history of voter fraud (see 2012 elections: allegations of ballot-stuffing)a blockchain based voting system would resolve the many issues I enumerated above, and Sierra Leone is not the only country to endure voter fraud. America also experienced interference during the 2016 election, and many other countries are similarly affected. By employing our software, we can ensure that democracy is being exercised in a fair and transparent way. Everyone\u2019s voice is being heard, everyone\u2019s vote is being counted, and the results would have guaranteed accuracy.\n\nThe pilot study I engaged in on the ground in Sierra Leone is just the beginning; we had a positive response from polling station managers to students to voting citizens themselves. We are already in talks with our contacts to bring blockchain powered voting to other African countries, as well as in Europe. It is an extremely exciting time, and there are high hopes for the future of democracy all over the world.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/86nhk2/observations_the_general_elections_in_sierra_leone/", "author": "DID_COMMS_ADMIN", "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/86nhk2/observations_the_general_elections_in_sierra_leone/"}, "86nkju": {"id": "86nkju", "subreddit": "r/ethereum", "created_utc": 1521834734.0, "title": "Subutai Blockchain Router", "text": "Just wanted to open discussion here, as we just kicked off our community channels.
