But while the numbers are flattening a bit, which hopefully bodes well, the pain is not yet over. New daily wallets were at 62,654 yesterday - the lowest number since last November. My guess is that about the same number of people are leaving the system as joining.\n\nI know this will be cold comfort to those holding ETH at 50% below purchase price, but I think there are grounds to be cautiously optimistic here, and not just because of lines on charts: sentiment is picking up on the back of a strong flow of positive news stories; the development landscape is powering ahead; and there has been a welcome if modest uptick in transaction volume. \n\nLooking at the relationship between the number of new wallets funded each day, and the daily ETH price, I wonder if we are about to see a crossover - where the number of new wallets increases relative to the price. If this happens there would very likely be a surge in the price as these two lines are elastically connected. Keep an eye on the new wallet number - if it bottoms out this week I\u2019d say we\u2019re looking good.\n\nBut in the meantime it looks like we'll have to hang on for a bit yet. \n\nGood luck everyone.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/86zhfk/the_sunday_chart_eth_price_vs_daily_new_wallets/", "author": "Nullius_123", "permalink": "/r/ethtrader/comments/86zhfk/the_sunday_chart_eth_price_vs_daily_new_wallets/"}, "86zik2": {"id": "86zik2", "subreddit": "r/ethtrader", "created_utc": 1521965957.0, "title": "I have made a simple airdrop site", "text": "Hi guys.

Is this solution good enough for the GDPR?", "text": "The new European regulations regarding user data privacy provides a big challenge to DApps on the Ethereum immutable blockchain.  The \"right to be forgotten\" that the GDPR demands means that users have the right to demand that their data can be fully erased if they request it.  There lies the inherent, giant conflict.\n\nIf there are any people here knowledgeable in both the GDPR and blockchain cryptography, please tell me if the following idea would satisfy the GDPR.  \n\nSuppose the data is stored in encrypted form, encrypted using a private key held by the user.  Note, this private key is *not* their wallet address key, but a special \"user data\" private key.  When the user wants to share data anyone, they or most likely a web app acting on their behalf, call a function providing their private key (not their Ethereum wallet private key, a separate private key created just to encrypt their private data on to the blockchain).  The web app passes the data on to the party the user wants to share the data with, along with the encrypted data blocks stored on the blockchain.  The encrypted user data blocks are requested from the host smart contract.\n\nThose encrypted user data blocks and the given private key are used to decrypt the data first and then the data is shared with the approved 3rd party. (Or they are decrypted to something like AES 256-bit resulting in a double data decrpytion at the data receivers end, so that the data is not passed in plain text form over the Web).\n\nIn other words, there is an OAuth-ish transaction done on the user's behalf to pass their private data on to any third party.\n\nAs a final failsafe, the user is given ownership of their smart contract and can execute a \"kill-contract\" operation at any time, knowing that they lose access to the data permanently if they do so.  Obviously there will need to be other verifications before executing this operation so that a malicious 3rd party that stole their *user data* private key doesn't do that just to create mayhem for the user.\n\nSo the data still resides on the blockchain in encrypted form, but without the user's private key it is useless to anyone except those parties they share the data with (without sharing their private as i mentioned above).\n\nWould that satisfy the GDPR's \"right-to-be-forgotten\" requirements?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/871tb6/immutable_ethereum_blockchain_and_the_gdpr_is/", "author": "vengeful_bunny", "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/871tb6/immutable_ethereum_blockchain_and_the_gdpr_is/"}, "871vto": {"id": "871vto", "subreddit": "r/ethereum", "created_utc": 1521996266.0, "title": "etheera", "text": "https://www.etheera.com ideal for brokers with an existing customer and property portfolio.

I hadn't bought a stock or an investment product anytime before in my life. I FELT I WAS RESPONSIBLE WITH MONEY. I went into this thinking I was one of the smartest men in town. \n\nLet me tell you do not go into this thinking you're super smart or you can jump into this and make insane money. I fomo'd in when Eth mooned 150%. I bought the top at the highest the market would be in 5 months. First off I thought I could daytrade.Newbies and chart chasers day trade and the ones who make money watching the 1hr charts are *experienced*.\n\nBeing Experienced in stocks or other investment products will not prepare you for crypto.Last year was a great time to get in even at 400 dollars or god forbid in ltc when it was $30. My first thoughts after dropping 2500 dollars on eth and watching the value drop 30% waiting for my funds was I can wait or I can recoup my money trading. I did everything a noob would do going into it but the reason I'm whole now is I didn't get in debt to buy digital currencies or invest more than I can lose.\n\nI also lost nearly everything I put in ,not chasing eth or btc. I chased pumps on alt coins thinking they'd moon and god did things moon but never for me. Don't buy an alt that you've just heard of on the daily. You are giving your money up to buy something that should hold value or utility.\n\nIf you think You won't have the chance to make what you lost back and you're depressed, yeah depression happens especially here and it's STRONGER than what is felt trading in stocks. If you can't handle stress of losing money and then panic sell, do not watch the charts. Forget your money for 6 months. It's an investment, not your job. swing trade or set stop losses. don't be dumb. If I had forgot about my purchase for 5 months i would've tripled my money. Play it smart guys hodling will save your precious internet money. If you don't think hodling would work You came for greedy reasons. Do you believe in eth otherwise if you can never come to that realization.\n\nIt took 13K to learn these lessons, don't be fucking dumb, listen to me. If you are new don't do what i did.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/870jy8/lessons_from_a_former_newbie/", "author": "beastlymelon", "permalink": "/r/ethtrader/comments/870jy8/lessons_from_a_former_newbie/"}, "871hcy": {"id": "871hcy", "subreddit": "r/ethtrader", "created_utc": 1521992767.0, "title": "Feedback on this New Feature?
