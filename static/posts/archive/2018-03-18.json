The company that has been doing a continuous ICO on Ethereum for about a year. Yeah, right. So they're issuing an Ethereum based token to raise Ethereum so that they can fund their platform that is supposedly better than Ethereum, but there is no product yet.\n\nThis would be like if I started a Facebook group called \"The Facebook Killer\" where I use Facebook to get a bunch of people excited about a new social network I'm promising that will be more scalable, more fair, faster, and better than Facebook, but all of this conversation exists within a Facebook group. I keep promising an incredible new website, but I also keep piggybacking on the success of something much more proven and battle tested.\n\nThen when I finally do come out with a product it turns out that we still have to work out all the usual kinks associated with other existing products and nothing actually ends up being improved. Seriously how do people fall for this?\n\n\"Decentralize Everything\", LOL, maybe start with \"Decentralize Something\" and see where that takes you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/85egne/the_ethereum_killer/", "author": "bytheway_imapilot", "permalink": "/r/ethtrader/comments/85egne/the_ethereum_killer/"}, "85ebbk": {"id": "85ebbk", "subreddit": "r/ethtrader", "created_utc": 1521408268.0, "title": "Advertise your crypto project on my website!", "text": "", "url": "https://cryptopiece.com/", "author": "CryptoPieceCom", "permalink": "/r/ethtrader/comments/85ebbk/advertise_your_crypto_project_on_my_website/"}, "85e5vr": {"id": "85e5vr", "subreddit": "r/ethtrader", "created_utc": 1521406915.0, "title": "G20: No regulation for cryptocurrencies", "text": "", "url": "https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-g20-regulations-carney/g20-watchdog-focuses-on-rules-review-holds-fire-on-cryptocurrencies-idUKKBN1GU0SF", "author": "Stale_meme_boy", "permalink": "/r/ethtrader/comments/85e5vr/g20_no_regulation_for_cryptocurrencies/"}, "85dm9r": {"id": "85dm9r", "subreddit": "r/ethtrader", "created_utc": 1521402333.0, "title": "This could all go so wrong, but we're so happy!!!", "text": "", "url": "https://youtu.be/rlOVEMHLAMc", "author": "gynoplasty", "permalink": "/r/ethtrader/comments/85dm9r/this_could_all_go_so_wrong_but_were_so_happy/"}, "85ddxr": {"id": "85ddxr", "subreddit": "r/ethtrader", "created_utc": 1521400326.0, "title": "Will Bitcoinus overtake PayPal?", "text": "", "url": "https://btcmanager.com/will-bitcoinus-overtake-paypal/", "author": "ringkk", "permalink": "/r/ethtrader/comments/85ddxr/will_bitcoinus_overtake_paypal/"}, "85es8u": {"id": "85es8u", "subreddit": "r/ethereum", "created_utc": 1521412463.0, "title": "Good news everyone!

When you click on a crypto, you can view live pricing as well as all of the top reddit posts for that crypto.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**For Crypto Developers**\nThe github for the website is completely opensource and available on https://github.com/apuente93/cgd\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI know, right now the site is very similar to [CoinMarketCap](https://www.coinmarketcap.com) and [LiveCoinWatch](https://www.livecoinwatch.com). The difference is that this site will be opensource, anyone can contribute and help build it. We are also not looking to make any money, so we will never have ads, and all donations will go to continued building and perfecting of the site.\nWe are here for all crypto lovers.
