It still takes forever to process even basic Eth transactions and gas costs turn away most people from using any DApp that doesn't also let you make a lot of money (why pay with little value-add?).\n\nScaling technologies like plasma, truebit, PoS and sharding are on the horizon, but are still quite a ways away from widespread use and implementation. Even MVPlasma (as implemented by OmiseGo and Truebit) or existing state-channel-based solutions are too technical for most people, and a huge pain to implement, currently.\n\nWe're excited to announce that we're building **Ethcalate: A containerized state channels management system for DApps.** \n\nThink of it as docker for scaling DApps more easily. Here's a quick breakdown of how it works:\n\n1. You link to our channel hub contract and stake funds either as a dapp or a user to open a channel.\n\n2. You connect to our hosted off-chain technology, which lets you configure your channel type and sign updates to your dapp state. Channels are then counterfactually instantiated, so they are only deployed to resolve disputes. [More on this here from the Spankchain team.](https://medium.com/spankchain/a-state-channels-adventure-with-counterfactual-rick-part-1-ce68e16252ea)\n\n3.
