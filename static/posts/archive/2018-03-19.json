Until recently, it was impossible to put out music without getting a record deal and relying on a label to record, distribute, and monetize your music as an artist. The same was true in film and television: You could not distribute a movie or TV show without studios and production companies throwing their weight behind you, and movie theaters or cable channels agreeing to showcase your creation.\nWhile the internet has now democratized content creation and distribution in entertainment and creatives no longer have to get in bed with the likes of Interscope or Disney, a new crop of middlemen have emerged in digital content. Today, users rely on platforms to consume music and video content. Platforms like YouTube (1.5 billion users), SoundCloud (175 million), Spotify (140 million) and Netflix (~110 million) control user consumption across the globe and act as the new distributors, responsible for both collecting subscription and ad revenues and divvying up payments to artists.\n\n[As  viewers and artists grow increasingly disillusioned with these platforms, they are looking for new options. Enter the blockchain.](https://on.live/)\n\nBy offering a digital public database that stores an ongoing record of transactions, the blockchain has given companies the ability to have completely encrypted records of ownership, as well as execute smart contracts (i.e. automatically enforce the exchange of anything of value without the need for a middleman). There are currently several attempts to create blockchain-based companies and currencies of relevance to media and entertainment. When applied to media consumption this technology solves the problems surrounding content access, distribution and compensation; managing assets and digital rights; and financing, among others.\n\n[ON.LIVE THE PART OF INNOVATION](https://on.live/) \n\nOnLive Network is a live video streaming protocol supported by Blockchain technology. Thanks to blockchain it assures full decentralization, high scalability and open market for uncensored live media broadcasts all over the world.OnLive solves bunch of problems from the offline world where one needs direct face-to-face contact with a professional to get essential advice.

Meanwhile, the price of Dai hasn't experienced truly major fluctuations.\n\nBut before the proponents of stablecoins triumphantly conclude that this shows that there is nothing to worry about, notice that the current downward Dai supply adjustment only released around $9 mln worth of ETH into circulation (given that Dai is collateralized 1.5 to 1), which is insignificant compared to the daily ETH trading volume.\n\nImagine, however, what would happen if the amount of collateral ETH released by a Dai supply adjustment were $900 mln instead?   \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/85luvr/my_criticism_of_stablecoins_like_dai_appears_to/", "author": "daniilgor", "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/85luvr/my_criticism_of_stablecoins_like_dai_appears_to/"}, "85lz4a": {"id": "85lz4a", "subreddit": "r/ethereum", "created_utc": 1521485576.0, "title": "US Congress Releases Extraordinary Report Praising Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Technology", "text": "", "url": "https://dailyhodl.com/2018/03/19/us-congress-releases-extraordinary-report-praising-cryptocurrency-and-blockchain-technology/", "author": "robcrypto", "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/85lz4a/us_congress_releases_extraordinary_report/"}, "85m19f": {"id": "85m19f", "subreddit": "r/ethereum", "created_utc": 1521486007.0, "title": "Numerai will give $1 million in crypto tokens to Kaggle users who sign up to its crowdsourced hedge fund", "text": "", "url": "https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/19/numerai-will-give-1-million-in-crypto-tokens-to-kaggle-users-who-sign-up-to-its-crowdsourced-hedge-fund/", "author": "rzurrer", "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/85m19f/numerai_will_give_1_million_in_crypto_tokens_to/"}, "85m3zq": {"id": "85m3zq", "subreddit": "r/ethereum", "created_utc": 1521486581.0, "title": "Mar 19 2018 Crypto Market Report - Contains Ethereum", "text": "", "url": "https://medium.com/@cryptotownio/mar-19-2018-crypto-market-report-b6d56c492eb4", "author": "cryptodator", "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/85m3zq/mar_19_2018_crypto_market_report_contains_ethereum/"}, "85m7bd": {"id": "85m7bd", "subreddit": "r/ethtrader", "created_utc": 1521487297.0, "title": "stopthefakes uses the eth block to stop counterfeiting", "text": "Hello,\n\nJust wanted to give a introduction to a project that makes good use of the erc blockchain to a actually offer a good service \n\nSTOPTHEFAKES is a decentralized service that utilizes crowd sourcing to help companies protect their intellectual property and physical property. \n\nPROBLEM: \n\nIn almost every sector worldwide counterfeiting remains a huge problem that grows bigger as time goes on. For example, in the pharmaceutical industry it is estimated that there is around 200 billion a year in counterfeit drugs (which equates to almost 60 percent of drugs being fake) and in the movie industry there is a 58 billion dollar theft in revenue from the movie industry from pirated movies. For smaller vendors like myself, my products are constantly counterfeited on Amazon, which has lead to me to have to file a brand complaint with Amazon, however, Amazon can not keep up with all the Chinese counterfeiters who pop up which leads to many brands being tarnished and loss of consumer confidence. Many small vendors cannot afford high powered firms to combat these counterfeiters. \n\nWhat we propose: \n\nStopthefakes will fill in the gaps by opening up a platform for every business or entity big or small to register counterfeit hunting jobs for \"doers\" to undertake. The doers can either actively hunt the counterfeiters or when they happen upon a counterfeit, they can search our platform for a job from that brand owner to see if their is an active job. The \"doer\" can send pictures, screenshots, or video in, and when the company approves, the \"doer\" can get paid with our tokens. \n\nWhy the need for erc20 tokens:\n\n Counterfeiting is worldwide and there is a need to expedite payment and have the \"doers\" be able to trade in their coins on the exchange for their local currency. This prevents the job posters and \"doers\" from having to deal with multiple currencies and having to pay the price of a fiat currency exchange. This means a company in Korea doesn't have to pay an America \"doer\" in Korean currency, which would most likely be inconvient for the \"doer\" and allows the companies to deal in their local currency instead of having many currencies on hand, or alternatively forcing the doers to take undesired currencies or use payment processes that take a bite out of profits.\n\nSecondly, smart contracts is a pseudo meditation system that allows \"doers\" and companies to make sure they are both treated fairly and get what they expect. There will also be a rating and scoring system, so there isn't a need to spend a large amount of resources curating and monitoring both parties to make sure they are living up to their responsibilities.\n\nWhy STF:\n\nthe ICO is in two days: however, they already have a sample doer app out and an alpha web service. Many ICOS have nothing even after their ICO.\n\nA 4.4 rating on ICOBENCH (almost 50 ratings). Software engineers, professional entrepreneurs, and even Fintech professionals rate them highly and believe stopthefakes shows promise.\n\nA strict adherence to their roadmap. they deliver on their promises and don't make excuses.\n\nthey attend conferences all over the world such as the Regtech conference and the Block chain leadership conference. they aren't perfect and there is much they have to improve and learn. they are always improving our craft.\n\nthey have partnered with Dogezer ICO recently in order to come up with an integrated solution to challenges, and they will have more in the future. \n\nsub reddit is /r stopthefakes and they have a contest on their to win some stopthefakes tokens coming shortly.\n\nwww.stopthefakes.io", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/85m7bd/stopthefakes_uses_the_eth_block_to_stop/", "author": "stopthescamsICO", "permalink": "/r/ethtrader/comments/85m7bd/stopthefakes_uses_the_eth_block_to_stop/"}, "85mbv5": {"id": "85mbv5", "subreddit": "r/ethereum", "created_utc": 1521488246.0, "title": "Building on Origin - Announcing our partnership with Blocklancer", "text": "", "url": "https://medium.com/originprotocol/building-on-origin-announcing-our-partnership-with-blocklancer-2fa76a082a14", "author": "cjladuke", "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/85mbv5/building_on_origin_announcing_our_partnership/"}, "85men1": {"id": "85men1", "subreddit": "r/ethereum", "created_utc": 1521488800.0, "title": "ICO's and Exchange Operations Could Be Frozen 12 Months", "text": "", "url": "https://www.btcnn.com/icos-and-exchange-operations-could-be-frozen-12-months/", "author": "linzerdshaffen", "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/85men1/icos_and_exchange_operations_could_be_frozen_12/"}, "85ksur": {"id": "85ksur", "subreddit": "r/ethtrader", "created_utc": 1521477026.0, "title": "Kevin O'Leary: NYC hotel wants to use a $400 million cryptocoin offering to sell ownership like a stock", "text": "", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/19/kevin-oleary-new-york-city-hotel-hopes-to-launch-400-million-dollar-coin-offering.html", "author": "thepipebomb", "permalink": "/r/ethtrader/comments/85ksur/kevin_oleary_nyc_hotel_wants_to_use_a_400_million/"}, "85knak": {"id": "85knak", "subreddit": "r/ethtrader", "created_utc": 1521475882.0, "title": "Here\u2019s a major blind spot in blockchain: is there a better use of the GPUs in the Ethereum world?
