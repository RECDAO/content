Whether we are dealing with MLM ponzis, unregistered securities, or Blockchain 4.0 snake oil, our #SOMO (Satisfaction Of Missing Out) does not discriminate. Please Enjoy!\n\n\nModex - https://concourseq.io/Q/Modex Centralised project, using blockchain for no real-reasons, while creating a token that is not really needed. Will collect fees amounting to 30% of each code sale, which is almost if not more than most current \nIntermediaries.\n\nConcierge - https://concourseq.io/Q/Concierge A Neo-native rebrand of their previously attempted unsuccessful Conciergecoin on Ethereum. The project has sold to the public under the branding of Pre-sale the same tokens at a 60% discount in February. The Token is not needed, and creates an additional layer of complexity on the platform while just acting as a funding vehicle for the team.\n\nPRETHER - https://concourseq.io/Q/PRETHER A crypto-currency backed with precious metals, with a CEO that has no previous experience, and a CIO who is a full time traveler. Website lists testimonials by Queen Elizabeth II and Ghandi, while one of the two advisors seems to be family related to the CEO.\n\nElementh - https://concourseq.io/Q/Elementh - The Same team has conducted a failed ICO (Ahoolee) for a somewhat similar idea \u201cSearch Engine for products\u201d and their product was supposed to launch in Dec 2017. Questionable value for the token since the platform will accept any cryptocurrency. \n\nBit Nautic - https://concourseq.io/Q/BitNautic A CEO who is still at University wants to buy a fleet of cargo ships, create a decentralised shipping platform and launch a debit card (blockchain fund-raising FTW, i guess). The Company that aims to cover all those fields was just registered to a flat in Jan 2018.\n\nParsec Frontiers - https://concourseq.io/Q/Parsec_Frontiers - Proposes to create a huge MMO game on the blockchain, while trying to combine Ethereum and \u201ca private chain\u201d without any blockchain development talent on the team.\n\nFaima - https://concourseq.io/Q/Faima - Whitepaper is advertising 722% gains and full of grammatical errors, typos and informal slang, making it look like it was run through an online translator. People that can\u2019t proofread a whitepaper rarely produce mad gainz.\n\nHYCON - https://concourseq.io/Q/HYCON - DAG based Infrastructure project with no code on Github! The team does not seem to be very proficient with the project documentation, and no have verifiable Blockchain track record for a project of this magnitude.\n\nBubbletone - https://concourseq.io/Q/Bubbletone - Touting their 4 months old Bubbletonel app, which is a standard internet instant messaging and calling app that has nothing to do with the scope of the project! The founders previous project (which does not seem to have taken off) was the same idea they are doing now without blockchain, possibly signaling that blockchain is not really necessary for the project.\n\nDiet Bitcoin https://concourseq.io/Q/Diet_Bitcoin - A Bitcoin fork by Pablo Escobar\u2019s brother.

I am a 33 married male living in San Diego currently making about 50k a year. So, I made my first purchase back in May, it was only for a couple hundred bucks. Back at that time, I had been investing in stocks for about five years. I had a total of 50k invested in all sorts of tech stocks. A few days later I bought my very first eth purchase at $130 with a credit card. I was trying to buy as much as I could, I was not afraid. in a matter of days I had a few thousand bucks. I was mainly buying eth. Eth shot up to $400 and suddenly realized that I had made over 30% gains (on average).\n\nThen, the ICO crash came, my guts where wrenching day by day, but ethtrader kept me sane, I learn to hodl like a pro and buy the dips. I started buying and buying more and eventually is started going up as soon as the bitcoin fork dilemma passed after August 1st. I took out money from a line of credit, I sold my netflix stock to buy more eth and alts. I had sold about 30k of stocks and put it all on eth. I saw btc go up and my eth and alts trading sideways. Another leason for me, do not under estimate bitcoin. It pissed me off that me and all my alts was being outperformed by noobs in coinbase simply holding btc. My portfolio was on the Red. Btc was sucking on everything.\n\nThen the ICO ban china news came and was I even more on the red, about -25% or probably more . But for some reason, I was not afraid, I knew it was going to go up eventually. I maybe had around 60k at that moment. Because I learned the lesson to never underestimate bitcoin. I later bought some more bitcoin and soon experience the btc and bch close flipping. I sold all my bch as soon as I got it on Bitfinex for about $500. Then the bch attack on btc happened and It was again gut wrenching as my portfolio was close to being on the red again, but it never did. I sold some btc for bch during the crisis.\n\nAfter the bch/btc dilemma, I sold all of my remaining stocks and went all in into cryoto to buy as much bitcoin as I could before the S2X fork - I wanted the free s2x coins. I was a good choice, btc was going up and going up and alts and eth was down. my porfolio grew slightly though. I splitted my btc for b2x futures in Bitfinex (bt1 and bt2) and sold all of the bt2 (b2x futures) for about .17 btc. Great move because the fork was cancelled and I was able to sell the futures. My porfolio started going up and going up. I started doing some arbitrage between exchanges, sometimes I would make a few hundred buck a day other days only 20 bucks.\n\nBy late November early December I broke the 100k. I could not believe I had 100k ( six figures!) and in a matter of only a few weeks. I originally wanted 100k for a down payment on a home in San Diego. I started looking for a 200k down payment and tell my wife to quit her job and go back to school. Hodling finally paid off, patience finally paid off. I was in mania! At that time, I decided not to check my balance anymore. It was too stressful, everyday I would gain or lose more than what I would make in months at my job. I stopped buying crypto because it was a few hundred bucks was going to make an impact on 300k. At that time was thinking of cashing out, but short term capital gains where going to kill me - paying over 45% in taxes! I had over 30 coin in total scattered all over the place. I had dozens of wallets and dozens of private keys neatly organized. I started buying stuff on craigslist with bitcoin directly. I was able to buy a mountain bike for .5 ether, my first and only crypto purchase so far.\n\nAt that time, around first week of January, alts and btc dropped but my ether and other coins kept my portfolio close to the 400k range. I decided to move all my coins to Bitfinex in order to sell if I really needed to. The following day, boom it crashes down to $13,000. Here is where I make a series of mistakes, while it dropped to $13k I started selling to at least keep my down payment needed for the house. I cashed out 200k in USDT and keep about 80k invested. The next day, I regretted that decision and bought my way in again. Well, in a few days it dropped down to $12k. I sold again, I sold only 150k need for my down payment (a smaller downpayment) and only keept about 50k invested. I then realized, that I had too much invested. I bought in with 50k so that left me with 100k USDT in Bitfinex. I was 100k cash an 100k invested. I later bought another 50k thinking that it was bottom. Mistake, I got a 10k loan when eth was around $800 thinking it was bottom. I was trying to catch a falling knife and I bleed hard.\n\nIn the next few days, I found out that was wife was pregnant. That changed everything, I meant that I could no longer continue to live with my inlaws and be patient and invest. I needed to move out and buy the house when the baby was going to able to walk. The baby is due in August, and hopefully I will able to move out in December. In the end, today it was my last straw. I sold most of investments and kept only 100k USDT and about 35k in a variety of crypto fund from Iconomi. I am definitely on the green, but now, living in San Diego I am having a hard time finding a home based on my income (average house price is over 500k!) Anyways, I guess my main tip to everyone is: Have fixed, measurable goals and stick to them. I had my moon and decided to go for the damn galaxy. I will finally be able to sleep at night, and not have to check my blockfolio every second. I am sorry for the awful grammar and spelling. I don't know how to format property. Feel free to ask me anything. (my cryptocompare portfolio is public for anyone to see by looking my username)\n\nEdit: 3/27/2018: some many edits due to grammar\n\nP.D: I finally got my Trezor Model-T I had ordered back in November.

It failed and I spent some time away from the project to think about strategy. During this time I used GrubHub and DoorDash and it became very clear what their weakness was... themselves. Fees and commissions littered across the entire process, carefully calculated to provide GrubHub & DoorDash with strong returns at the expense of the customer and food establishments. All while the driver is receiving just enough to make it worth their time as a side-gig. \n\nThat's when it clicked. I'll just take Food Raptor out of Food Raptor. Eliminate the middle-man through utilization of smart contracts and provide incentive for all actors facilitate long-term improvement and moderation of the platform.\n\nBelow I go over the advantages I have identified that a DAO platform has over a centralized organization for food establishments (providers), deliverers (vehicles), and customers. The concepts below present an extremely simplified narrative of platform requirements for development, execution, and long-term continuity. Please take that into consideration when reviewing. The purpose of sharing this information is to begin building a community to support and further determine, evaluate requirements, and develop this project.\n\nThe documentation includes all of the information below and may be easier to read: https://foodraptor.com/Food-Raptor-White-Paper-v1.0.1.pdf\n\n**ADVANTAGES**\n\n**FOOD ESTABLISHMENTS**\n\nUnlike centralized food delivery services, there is no charge to receive orders through Food Raptor. Utilization of the Food Raptor application would have no cost for the provider, except for the transaction fees to update core information. To keep transaction costs to a minimum, non-core information will be stored and hosted utilizing a content delivery service such as AWS to provide end user content. Associated content delivery service costs will be absorbed by the order contract initiator (customer). \n\n**INCENTIVE TO PURCHASE FDR**\n\nThe incentive for providers to purchase FDR include:\n\n**Lower the cost of delivery for their customers to make ordering from their establishment more attractive.** \n*FDR can be sent to the provider\u2019s contract and a payout type (fixed or percentage) and rate variable is set to dictate how much FDR will be contributed to each order. \n\n**Promote the visibility of their contract (their establishment) on Food Raptor** \n*FDR can be sent to the provider\u2019s contract and a payout type (PPC or CPM) and rate variable is set to control when this contract is displayed as promoted. \n\n**VEHICLES**\n\nExisting food delivery services currently raise multiple fees and charge both the customer and provider for using their platform.  These costs are compiled as the cost of service. \n\nIn a decentralized organization we are able to remove the margin a centralized organization would take, sometimes as much as a 13.5% commission to the provider and various other charges to the customer. Doing this allows the vehicle to request and earn more for the service performed while lowering the actual cost of delivery for the customer. \n \nINCENTIVE FOR VEHICLES TO CHOOSE FOODRAPTOR\n\nThe Food Raptor delivery system would be open to anyone who has access to the internet. This makes it possible for anyone to sign-up and begin delivering in minutes. \n\nThe Food Raptor System would allow each vehicle to set their own price.\n\nAs mentioned above, by taking out the unnecessary fees charged by centralized organizations, this will allow vehicles to charge higher delivery costs because the overall delivery cost will more closely reflect the amount being paid for the delivery service. \n\n**DECENTRALIZATION EXCEPTIONS**\n\nIn order to provide an experience that can compete with centralized organizations, certain centralized service requirements have been assumed. It is the community and contributing developers' responsibility to ensure that these services, although centralized, are publicly managed and paid. These services include:\n\n**Google Maps API**\n* For tracking vehicle locations.\n\n**Push Notification Supplier [TBD]**\n* For pushing order status notifications between all users.\n\nWHAT ARE VEHICLES?\n\n*The usage of the term vehicle is in regards to the method in which a delivery is fulfilled. This includes human, human controlled, and autonomous methods. *\n\n**CUSTOMERS**\n\nCentralized delivery services charge customers raise fees to use their platform to place orders in order to return a profit. A decentralized organization such as Food Raptor will allow customers to pay less because they are only paying what is required to satisfy content delivery service costs and the vehicle\u2019s minimum requirements. \n\nIn addition, the provider\u2019s usage of FDR drives down the cost of the delivery, and in some cases the cost of delivery for the customer may be completely covered depending on how the provider has configured the award payout and the order total.   \n\n**INCENTIVE FOR CUSTOMERS TO CHOOSE FOODRAPTOR**\n\nThe Food Raptor delivery system does not work to benefit any particular user group, but the system as a whole. This means competition for the customer\u2019s business has a direct positive influence on how much the customer pays for delivery, not how much an organization will profit for promoting a particular user group such as the providers or vehicles.\n\n**INCENTIVE TO PURCHASE FDR**\n\n**Customers must use the FDR to place and pay for orders on Food Raptor.**\n* The USD/FDR exchange process must be seamless and integrated into the dApp checkout to successfully compete with the experience existing centralized services provide. \n\n**SMART CONTRACTS & COST CALCULATIONS**\nProposed functions and relationships are covered in more detail in the documentation: https://foodraptor.com/Food-Raptor-White-Paper-v1.0.1.pdf\n\n**PROPOSED WAGER SYSTEM**\n\nTo build trust between all user groups, vehicles and providers may transfer FDR to their smart contract as a guarantee to the customer. \n\nAny user can claim there is an illegitimate party involved in the order for the order to be deactivated and set the inResolution variable to true. When this function is executed, wager funds are pulled from the vehicle and provider contract if available. \n\nWhen the contract is in resolution, the highest confirmation requirement of all involved parties is used as the actual confirmation. Other third parties will be able to interact with the contract to confirm or deny the claim. The resolution system will tightly correlate to the value of FDR, the wager payout in FDR should persuade contributors to answer with their best judgement to preserve and strengthen the value of the FDR.\n\nAs an award for contributing to the security and trust of the system, confirmation actors receive an equal percentage of the wager remainder. Wager payouts are held for 14 days to further prevent bad actors from quickly or wrongly confirming or denying claims to receive FDR.\n\nWhether the claim is approved or denied will affect the vehicle and providers listing contracts reputation score by updating claimGuilt and claimCount variables on the vehicle or provider contract. \n\n**DISCLOSURE**\nMany unidentified risks and challenges will arise during and post development. Many core requirements and details need to be gathered and evaluated. Many statements, concepts, and suggestions are only partially developed. The proposed timeline is hypothetical and is likely to change. All objectives are hypothetical, some may not be possible to accomplish.\n\nI can't express enough this is a concept and has an immense amount of requirement gathering and evaluation to be completed to truly determine the plausibility of everything mentioned above. \n\n*So what's my angle?*\n\nThe current concept runs off the assumption that funding will be needed to develop this project, although I assume it's possible community contributions could fully develop the project. At this point and time, the proposed method of raising funds is through the sale of the FDR token, and I would like to retain 10% of the FDR. This is not a requirement and I am very flexible on this. If the successful launch of this platform required me to relinquish all FDR, I would do what is necessary to increase the likelihood of project success. By day I am a process development project manager, I am familiar and experienced and skilled in managing agile SDLCs at an enterprise level. I intend on staying the project to facilitate development and preserve the project's initial mission.\n \nTransparency and community will make or break this project. \n\nI look forward to seeing some responses and receiving constructive feedback. Even more so, I look forward to any community interest and involvement to begin shaping this into something amazing. A Slack workspace has been set up to collaborate for now.

Maybe hodlers? I digress. \n\nWhat is an ERC20 token? Well, yes it's a token based on Ethereum, but how is it different than say... ERC721? What does non-fungible mean? These are questions you should research yourself, because if you don't know the answer you may not understand why Coinbase is supporting them, why it might not be supporting other token standards, and how that affects the general marketplace. \n\nMy participation thus far is quite limited, but in the beginning of this year I made a decision to look into more tokens than Ethereum on the simple basis that there is more value to be gained from these projects, as ETH has been grown on speculation, and while it may yet grow to a factor of 10, or even 100 fold (unlikely), it is nearly impossible to grow 1000 fold, and I **know** that intrigues some people here (even if you tell me otherwise). \n\nWith that said, I thought about a few strategies. They're hodler strategies, because we all know how trading goes for most of us (not to mention the benefits for LTCG with holding). \n\nYou could go out and buy 20 of the top ERC-20 tokens based on market cap. I get it, it might make sense, but it kind of misses the target. What are you basing the current value on? What are you basing the future value on? These are important questions, and know that you aren't the only one asking them (if you're worried, other people might be too! The reverse is also true). \n\nMy strategy? Pick 3. Something like 60-25-15 and forget about them. It's extremely high risk, and it's quite possible I'll lose all my money (so this isn't investment advice - just hodler stuff). \n\nCome May 1st, I'm expecting a market to slowly transition to a long term stagnation / eventual bull market, and the coins being added to Coinbase are likely to see some interesting gains (depending on how low their existing market cap is). \n\nIf you need to know how to get these coins, I can't really recommend anything, but Kyber.network launched recently and shapeshift.io has been around for a while (but it has expensive fees). Both are currently deemed safe, but I recommend to hold your own private keys and be careful who has authenticated your account (in case of compromise). \n\nWhich tokens specifically? Well, my idea was to stay out of the top 10, thinking about what tokens I could see being in the top 10 and actually holding that position. I look at real value. \n\nMy thoughts? \n\nA few reasonable picks: \n\nOMG, BAT, 0x, GNT, \n\nA few higher risk picks: \n\nRDN, KNT, FUN \n\n\nIt's not investor advice, be smart.", "permalink": "/r/ethtrader/comments/87jfge/in_honor_of_terrible_token_tuesdays_im_providing/", "title": "In honor of Terrible Token Tuesdays, I'm providing my two cents on contributing and growing value in the existing ERC20 token market", "created_utc": 1522165452.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/87jfge/in_honor_of_terrible_token_tuesdays_im_providing/", "author": "jdero"}, "87kn0n": {"subreddit": "r/ethereum", "id": "87kn0n", "text": "", "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/87kn0n/breaking_news_ethlend_03_kogia_testnet_launch/", "title": "Breaking News: ETHLend 0.3 Kogia Testnet Launch Announced \u2014 User Experience in Focus", "created_utc": 1522173985.0, "url": "https://blog.ethlend.io/breaking-news-ethlend-0-3-kogia-testnet-launch-announced-user-experience-in-focus-db01231354f", "author": "EthWarrior"}, "87fiik": {"subreddit": "r/ethereum", "id": "87fiik", "text": "", "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/87fiik/griddeth_place_pixels_on_a_public_grid_for_just/", "title": "Griddeth: Place pixels on a public grid for just gas, inspired by r/place", "created_utc": 1522123495.0, "url": "http://griddeth.com/", "author": "WontonSnoop"}, "87hq1y": {"subreddit": "r/ethereum", "id": "87hq1y", "text": "", "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/87hq1y/the_phenomenon_of_smart_contract_honeypots/", "title": "The phenomenon of smart contract honeypots", "created_utc": 1522151006.0, "url": "https://medium.com/@gerhard.wagner/the-phenomena-of-smart-contract-honeypots-755c1f943f7b", "author": "fagnerbrack"}, "87hnln": {"subreddit": "r/ethtrader", "id": "87hnln", "text": "", "permalink": "/r/ethtrader/comments/87hnln/mark_the_jester_from_leicester_selby_about/", "title": "Mark \u2018The Jester From Leicester\u2019 Selby about Restart Energy", "created_utc": 1522150247.0, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wi_ZD2g3gi4&feature=youtu.be", "author": "mme102"}, "87e80r": {"subreddit": "r/ethtrader", "id": "87e80r", "text": "", "permalink": "/r/ethtrader/comments/87e80r/increased_github_scrutiny_means_lazy_ico/", "title": "Increased Github Scrutiny Means Lazy ICO Developers Have No Place to Hide", "created_utc": 1522111119.0, "url": "https://news.bitcoin.com/increased-github-scrutiny-means-lazy-ico-developers-have-no-place-to-hide/", "author": "BobsBurgers3Bitcoin"}, "87m5qs": {"subreddit": "r/ethereum", "id": "87m5qs", "text": "Just got my early access link", "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/87m5qs/you_can_now_trade_ethereum_bitcoin_on_robinhood/", "title": "You can now trade Ethereum & Bitcoin on Robinhood!", "created_utc": 1522184638.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/87m5qs/you_can_now_trade_ethereum_bitcoin_on_robinhood/", "author": "Estrada123"}, "87ncss": {"subreddit": "r/ethereum", "id": "87ncss", "text": "Hey guys!\n\nI'm building a chat bot app on Toshi messenger.

At best, Ethereum and similar technologies will underpin the foundation of our digital infrastructure, reshaping the way we interact in fundamental ways.\n\nAnd none of that has changed between January and now.

Bear markets are fantastic times to accumulate. Just buy a small amount at a time with each drop. Don't try to time the bottom--you probably be unsuccessful. Believers should be ecstatic right now, we've just washed out so many people who were just in it for some quick cash. You really don't think they'll be back once things start turning around? If you're truly a long-term believer, your objective should be to max the amount of ETH you have, and not worry about its present-day value.\n\nI guess if you think that ETH is done and going to zero then sure be upset, but otherwise rejoice! This is a gift. Remember those stupid Chappelle memes? Well, your wish has been granted, so don't waste it. \n\nAnd if you are upset because you had 100% of your fiat already invested, I'd honestly say that's your own damn fault. It's incredibly risky to be 100% invested in a single asset, much less an asset as volatile as crypto. Let this be a lesson to you. Chances are you are young and you'll have your whole life ahead of you to invest, so learn something from your mistakes and don't repeat them. Especially given how bullish the world economy has been, I think you'd be unwise to not have some proportion of your investments in either cash or a very safe asset right now.\n\nAlways remember the sage advise of Warren Buffet:\n\"Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful\"\n\nDude's the 3rd richest man on earth.

This is a smart contract and website where Ethereum users can pledge to donate a certain amount to an address (ideally a charity of some sort), which gets sent only if others match that amount. Upon creating a pledge to donate a certain amount to some address, the user sends that Ether to the EthPledge smart contract, and if others donate to that pledge too up to that amount of Ether it all gets sent to the charity address. You can also pledge to donate several times what others do (eg. you could put up 10 Ether, and say that if others donate only 2 Ether it'll all get sent to the charity address).\n\nIt is fairly common for companies to do giving pledges like this (\"we'll match anything employees donate to this charity\") and having something like this on the Ethereum blockchain makes it 100% transparent and by going through a smart contract can guarantee someone holds up their end of the bargain. There is at least one major international charity with an Ethereum address for donations, Heifer International (https://www.heifer.org/what-you-can-do/give/digital-currency.html) and I've created the first pledge on the website to donate 0.1 Ether to them: see http://www.ethpledge.com/id/0 :) (look at it while connected to the mainnet).\n\nShould you create a pledge and then cancel it, you'll get a refund of your pledge amount in line with how much others have donated - if you cancel the pledge when 10% of the donation target has been reached, for example, 10% of your pledge amount (along with the donations) will be sent to the charity address, and 90% of the pledge amount you put up will be returned to you.\n\nThe verified contract code is at https://etherscan.io/address/0x10ec03b714a2660581040c1a0329d88e381ca603 and I've also uploaded the code for the website/UI at https://github.com/wanshun123/EthPledge if that's of interest to anyone.\n\nFeedback and criticism very much welcome.", "permalink": "/r/ethtrader/comments/87gkhl/ethpledge_smart_contract_for_matching_charity/", "title": "EthPledge: Smart contract for matching charity donations (x/post /r/ethereum)", "created_utc": 1522136382.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/87gkhl/ethpledge_smart_contract_for_matching_charity/", "author": "hanyuqn"}, "87lo5g": {"subreddit": "r/ethereum", "id": "87lo5g", "text": "", "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/87lo5g/opskins_welcomes_decentraland_opskins_marketplace/", "title": "OPSkins Welcomes Decentraland - OPSkins Marketplace Blog", "created_utc": 1522181201.0, "url": "https://blog.opskins.com/opskins-welcomes-decentraland/", "author": "dragonfrugal"}, "87fo4l": {"subreddit": "r/ethereum", "id": "87fo4l", "text": "", "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/87fo4l/what_the_sec_should_focus_on_with_crypto/", "title": "What The SEC Should Focus On With Crypto.", "created_utc": 1522125211.0, "url": "https://abovecrypto.com/all-posts/what-the-sec/", "author": "stulkenm"}, "87nnwp": {"subreddit": "r/ethtrader", "id": "87nnwp", "text": "Hi guys, let me introduce you to Blok, the new maestro in town, revolutionizing the global gig economy by leveraging blockchain to remove frictions impeding the on-demand workforce. \n\nThe gig economy, as well as, blockchain, are both booming at the moment, and will continue to grow for the foreseeable future. \n\nJust putting it out here if someone wants to target it for their next ICO investment, and be part of the next big thing.\n\nWebsite: https://blok.network\n\nFollow the sub: https://www.reddit.com/r/blok/\n\nJoin the conversation on Telegram: https://t.me/blokcommunity", "permalink": "/r/ethtrader/comments/87nnwp/blok_introduction_to_community/", "title": "Blok - Introduction to community", "created_utc": 1522197230.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/87nnwp/blok_introduction_to_community/", "author": "a_blok"}, "87id33": {"subreddit": "r/ethtrader", "id": "87id33", "text": "I bought some ETH on Coinbase back in the summer when it was supported in Canada, now it is not.
