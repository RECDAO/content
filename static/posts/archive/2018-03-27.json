It failed and I spent some time away from the project to think about strategy. During this time I used GrubHub and DoorDash and it became very clear what their weakness was... themselves. Fees and commissions littered across the entire process, carefully calculated to provide GrubHub & DoorDash with strong returns at the expense of the customer and food establishments. All while the driver is receiving just enough to make it worth their time as a side-gig. \n\nThat's when it clicked. I'll just take Food Raptor out of Food Raptor. Eliminate the middle-man through utilization of smart contracts and provide incentive for all actors facilitate long-term improvement and moderation of the platform.\n\nBelow I go over the advantages I have identified that a DAO platform has over a centralized organization for food establishments (providers), deliverers (vehicles), and customers. The concepts below present an extremely simplified narrative of platform requirements for development, execution, and long-term continuity. Please take that into consideration when reviewing. The purpose of sharing this information is to begin building a community to support and further determine, evaluate requirements, and develop this project.\n\nThe documentation includes all of the information below and may be easier to read: https://foodraptor.com/Food-Raptor-White-Paper-v1.0.1.pdf\n\n**ADVANTAGES**\n\n**FOOD ESTABLISHMENTS**\n\nUnlike centralized food delivery services, there is no charge to receive orders through Food Raptor. Utilization of the Food Raptor application would have no cost for the provider, except for the transaction fees to update core information. To keep transaction costs to a minimum, non-core information will be stored and hosted utilizing a content delivery service such as AWS to provide end user content. Associated content delivery service costs will be absorbed by the order contract initiator (customer). \n\n**INCENTIVE TO PURCHASE FDR**\n\nThe incentive for providers to purchase FDR include:\n\n**Lower the cost of delivery for their customers to make ordering from their establishment more attractive.** \n*FDR can be sent to the provider\u2019s contract and a payout type (fixed or percentage) and rate variable is set to dictate how much FDR will be contributed to each order. \n\n**Promote the visibility of their contract (their establishment) on Food Raptor** \n*FDR can be sent to the provider\u2019s contract and a payout type (PPC or CPM) and rate variable is set to control when this contract is displayed as promoted. \n\n**VEHICLES**\n\nExisting food delivery services currently raise multiple fees and charge both the customer and provider for using their platform.  These costs are compiled as the cost of service. \n\nIn a decentralized organization we are able to remove the margin a centralized organization would take, sometimes as much as a 13.5% commission to the provider and various other charges to the customer. Doing this allows the vehicle to request and earn more for the service performed while lowering the actual cost of delivery for the customer. \n \nINCENTIVE FOR VEHICLES TO CHOOSE FOODRAPTOR\n\nThe Food Raptor delivery system would be open to anyone who has access to the internet. This makes it possible for anyone to sign-up and begin delivering in minutes. \n\nThe Food Raptor System would allow each vehicle to set their own price.\n\nAs mentioned above, by taking out the unnecessary fees charged by centralized organizations, this will allow vehicles to charge higher delivery costs because the overall delivery cost will more closely reflect the amount being paid for the delivery service. \n\n**DECENTRALIZATION EXCEPTIONS**\n\nIn order to provide an experience that can compete with centralized organizations, certain centralized service requirements have been assumed. It is the community and contributing developers' responsibility to ensure that these services, although centralized, are publicly managed and paid. These services include:\n\n**Google Maps API**\n* For tracking vehicle locations.\n\n**Push Notification Supplier [TBD]**\n* For pushing order status notifications between all users.\n\nWHAT ARE VEHICLES?\n\n*The usage of the term vehicle is in regards to the method in which a delivery is fulfilled. This includes human, human controlled, and autonomous methods. *\n\n**CUSTOMERS**\n\nCentralized delivery services charge customers raise fees to use their platform to place orders in order to return a profit. A decentralized organization such as Food Raptor will allow customers to pay less because they are only paying what is required to satisfy content delivery service costs and the vehicle\u2019s minimum requirements. \n\nIn addition, the provider\u2019s usage of FDR drives down the cost of the delivery, and in some cases the cost of delivery for the customer may be completely covered depending on how the provider has configured the award payout and the order total.   \n\n**INCENTIVE FOR CUSTOMERS TO CHOOSE FOODRAPTOR**\n\nThe Food Raptor delivery system does not work to benefit any particular user group, but the system as a whole. This means competition for the customer\u2019s business has a direct positive influence on how much the customer pays for delivery, not how much an organization will profit for promoting a particular user group such as the providers or vehicles.\n\n**INCENTIVE TO PURCHASE FDR**\n\n**Customers must use the FDR to place and pay for orders on Food Raptor.**\n* The USD/FDR exchange process must be seamless and integrated into the dApp checkout to successfully compete with the experience existing centralized services provide. \n\n**SMART CONTRACTS & COST CALCULATIONS**\nProposed functions and relationships are covered in more detail in the documentation: https://foodraptor.com/Food-Raptor-White-Paper-v1.0.1.pdf\n\n**PROPOSED WAGER SYSTEM**\n\nTo build trust between all user groups, vehicles and providers may transfer FDR to their smart contract as a guarantee to the customer. \n\nAny user can claim there is an illegitimate party involved in the order for the order to be deactivated and set the inResolution variable to true. When this function is executed, wager funds are pulled from the vehicle and provider contract if available. \n\nWhen the contract is in resolution, the highest confirmation requirement of all involved parties is used as the actual confirmation. Other third parties will be able to interact with the contract to confirm or deny the claim. The resolution system will tightly correlate to the value of FDR, the wager payout in FDR should persuade contributors to answer with their best judgement to preserve and strengthen the value of the FDR.\n\nAs an award for contributing to the security and trust of the system, confirmation actors receive an equal percentage of the wager remainder. Wager payouts are held for 14 days to further prevent bad actors from quickly or wrongly confirming or denying claims to receive FDR.\n\nWhether the claim is approved or denied will affect the vehicle and providers listing contracts reputation score by updating claimGuilt and claimCount variables on the vehicle or provider contract. \n\n**DISCLOSURE**\nMany unidentified risks and challenges will arise during and post development. Many core requirements and details need to be gathered and evaluated. Many statements, concepts, and suggestions are only partially developed. The proposed timeline is hypothetical and is likely to change. All objectives are hypothetical, some may not be possible to accomplish.\n\nI can't express enough this is a concept and has an immense amount of requirement gathering and evaluation to be completed to truly determine the plausibility of everything mentioned above. \n\n*So what's my angle?*\n\nThe current concept runs off the assumption that funding will be needed to develop this project, although I assume it's possible community contributions could fully develop the project. At this point and time, the proposed method of raising funds is through the sale of the FDR token, and I would like to retain 10% of the FDR. This is not a requirement and I am very flexible on this. If the successful launch of this platform required me to relinquish all FDR, I would do what is necessary to increase the likelihood of project success. By day I am a process development project manager, I am familiar and experienced and skilled in managing agile SDLCs at an enterprise level. I intend on staying the project to facilitate development and preserve the project's initial mission.\n \nTransparency and community will make or break this project. \n\nI look forward to seeing some responses and receiving constructive feedback. Even more so, I look forward to any community interest and involvement to begin shaping this into something amazing. A Slack workspace has been set up to collaborate for now.

This is a smart contract and website where Ethereum users can pledge to donate a certain amount to an address (ideally a charity of some sort), which gets sent only if others match that amount. Upon creating a pledge to donate a certain amount to some address, the user sends that Ether to the EthPledge smart contract, and if others donate to that pledge too up to that amount of Ether it all gets sent to the charity address. You can also pledge to donate several times what others do (eg. you could put up 10 Ether, and say that if others donate only 2 Ether it'll all get sent to the charity address).\n\nIt is fairly common for companies to do giving pledges like this (\"we'll match anything employees donate to this charity\") and having something like this on the Ethereum blockchain makes it 100% transparent and by going through a smart contract can guarantee someone holds up their end of the bargain. There is at least one major international charity with an Ethereum address for donations, Heifer International (https://www.heifer.org/what-you-can-do/give/digital-currency.html) and I've created the first pledge on the website to donate 0.1 Ether to them: see http://www.ethpledge.com/id/0 :) (look at it while connected to the mainnet).\n\nShould you create a pledge and then cancel it, you'll get a refund of your pledge amount in line with how much others have donated - if you cancel the pledge when 10% of the donation target has been reached, for example, 10% of your pledge amount (along with the donations) will be sent to the charity address, and 90% of the pledge amount you put up will be returned to you.\n\nThe verified contract code is at https://etherscan.io/address/0x10ec03b714a2660581040c1a0329d88e381ca603 and I've also uploaded the code for the website/UI at https://github.com/wanshun123/EthPledge if that's of interest to anyone.\n\nFeedback and criticism very much welcome.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/87gkhl/ethpledge_smart_contract_for_matching_charity/", "author": "hanyuqn", "permalink": "/r/ethtrader/comments/87gkhl/ethpledge_smart_contract_for_matching_charity/"}, "87glby": {"id": "87glby", "subreddit": "r/ethereum", "created_utc": 1522136708.0, "title": "Geth v1.8.3 released!

Please Enjoy!\n\n\nModex - https://concourseq.io/Q/Modex Centralised project, using blockchain for no real-reasons, while creating a token that is not really needed. Will collect fees amounting to 30% of each code sale, which is almost if not more than most current \nIntermediaries.\n\nConcierge - https://concourseq.io/Q/Concierge A Neo-native rebrand of their previously attempted unsuccessful Conciergecoin on Ethereum. The project has sold to the public under the branding of Pre-sale the same tokens at a 60% discount in February. The Token is not needed, and creates an additional layer of complexity on the platform while just acting as a funding vehicle for the team.\n\nPRETHER - https://concourseq.io/Q/PRETHER A crypto-currency backed with precious metals, with a CEO that has no previous experience, and a CIO who is a full time traveler. Website lists testimonials by Queen Elizabeth II and Ghandi, while one of the two advisors seems to be family related to the CEO.\n\nElementh - https://concourseq.io/Q/Elementh - The Same team has conducted a failed ICO (Ahoolee) for a somewhat similar idea \u201cSearch Engine for products\u201d and their product was supposed to launch in Dec 2017. Questionable value for the token since the platform will accept any cryptocurrency. \n\nBit Nautic - https://concourseq.io/Q/BitNautic A CEO who is still at University wants to buy a fleet of cargo ships, create a decentralised shipping platform and launch a debit card (blockchain fund-raising FTW, i guess). The Company that aims to cover all those fields was just registered to a flat in Jan 2018.\n\nParsec Frontiers - https://concourseq.io/Q/Parsec_Frontiers - Proposes to create a huge MMO game on the blockchain, while trying to combine Ethereum and \u201ca private chain\u201d without any blockchain development talent on the team.\n\nFaima - https://concourseq.io/Q/Faima - Whitepaper is advertising 722% gains and full of grammatical errors, typos and informal slang, making it look like it was run through an online translator. People that can\u2019t proofread a whitepaper rarely produce mad gainz.\n\nHYCON - https://concourseq.io/Q/HYCON - DAG based Infrastructure project with no code on Github! The team does not seem to be very proficient with the project documentation, and no have verifiable Blockchain track record for a project of this magnitude.\n\nBubbletone - https://concourseq.io/Q/Bubbletone - Touting their 4 months old Bubbletonel app, which is a standard internet instant messaging and calling app that has nothing to do with the scope of the project! The founders previous project (which does not seem to have taken off) was the same idea they are doing now without blockchain, possibly signaling that blockchain is not really necessary for the project.\n\nDiet Bitcoin https://concourseq.io/Q/Diet_Bitcoin - A Bitcoin fork by Pablo Escobar\u2019s brother. We\u2019d tell you more, but we want you to click the link.\n\nThe ConcourseQ team would like to thank everybody that helped on these DDs and all the others!

Maybe hodlers? I digress. \n\nWhat is an ERC20 token? Well, yes it's a token based on Ethereum, but how is it different than say... ERC721? What does non-fungible mean? These are questions you should research yourself, because if you don't know the answer you may not understand why Coinbase is supporting them, why it might not be supporting other token standards, and how that affects the general marketplace. \n\nMy participation thus far is quite limited, but in the beginning of this year I made a decision to look into more tokens than Ethereum on the simple basis that there is more value to be gained from these projects, as ETH has been grown on speculation, and while it may yet grow to a factor of 10, or even 100 fold (unlikely), it is nearly impossible to grow 1000 fold, and I **know** that intrigues some people here (even if you tell me otherwise). \n\nWith that said, I thought about a few strategies. They're hodler strategies, because we all know how trading goes for most of us (not to mention the benefits for LTCG with holding). \n\nYou could go out and buy 20 of the top ERC-20 tokens based on market cap. I get it, it might make sense, but it kind of misses the target. What are you basing the current value on? What are you basing the future value on? These are important questions, and know that you aren't the only one asking them (if you're worried, other people might be too! The reverse is also true). \n\nMy strategy? Pick 3. Something like 60-25-15 and forget about them. It's extremely high risk, and it's quite possible I'll lose all my money (so this isn't investment advice - just hodler stuff). \n\nCome May 1st, I'm expecting a market to slowly transition to a long term stagnation / eventual bull market, and the coins being added to Coinbase are likely to see some interesting gains (depending on how low their existing market cap is). \n\nIf you need to know how to get these coins, I can't really recommend anything, but Kyber.network launched recently and shapeshift.io has been around for a while (but it has expensive fees). Both are currently deemed safe, but I recommend to hold your own private keys and be careful who has authenticated your account (in case of compromise). \n\nWhich tokens specifically? Well, my idea was to stay out of the top 10, thinking about what tokens I could see being in the top 10 and actually holding that position. I look at real value. \n\nMy thoughts? \n\nA few reasonable picks: \n\nOMG, BAT, 0x, GNT, \n\nA few higher risk picks: \n\nRDN, KNT, FUN \n\n\nIt's not investor advice, be smart.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/87jfge/in_honor_of_terrible_token_tuesdays_im_providing/", "author": "jdero", "permalink": "/r/ethtrader/comments/87jfge/in_honor_of_terrible_token_tuesdays_im_providing/"}, "87jh6q": {"id": "87jh6q", "subreddit": "r/ethereum", "created_utc": 1522165794.0, "title": "[Dapp] The Chibi fighters have been released", "text": "", "url": "https://chibifighters.io/referral.php?id=5", "author": "Jensanko", "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/87jh6q/dapp_the_chibi_fighters_have_been_released/"}, "87jle9": {"id": "87jle9", "subreddit": "r/ethereum", "created_utc": 1522166671.0, "title": "Can you recommend me a good and up to date Solidity tutorial?", "text": "", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/87jle9/can_you_recommend_me_a_good_and_up_to_date/", "author": "cryptohazard", "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/87jle9/can_you_recommend_me_a_good_and_up_to_date/"}, "87jmsb": {"id": "87jmsb", "subreddit": "r/ethereum", "created_utc": 1522166939.0, "title": "uPort now on any Ethereum blockchain", "text": "", "url": "https://medium.com/uport/uport-on-any-ethereum-blockchain-c54368a12e8c", "author": "pelle", "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/87jmsb/uport_now_on_any_ethereum_blockchain/"}, "87jnww": {"id": "87jnww", "subreddit": "r/ethereum", "created_utc": 1522167151.0, "title": "Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse Group Wants to Develop a Blockchain-Based Platform", "text": "", "url": "https://the-blockchain-journal.com/2018/03/27/deutsche-borse-group-wants-to-develop-a-blockchain-based-platform/", "author": "Leaders17", "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/87jnww/deutsche_b\u00e3rse_group_wants_to_develop_a/"}, "87jt7e": {"id": "87jt7e", "subreddit": "r/ethereum", "created_utc": 1522168173.0, "title": "uPort on any Ethereum blockchain: Why uPort Supports Multiple Networks & Application Accounts", "text": "", "url": "https://medium.com/uport/uport-on-any-ethereum-blockchain-c54368a12e8c", "author": "jdbender66", "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/87jt7e/uport_on_any_ethereum_blockchain_why_uport/"}, "87juxd": {"id": "87juxd", "subreddit": "r/ethereum", "created_utc": 1522168514.0, "title": "Governance in 0x Protocol", "text": "", "url": "https://blog.0xproject.com/governance-in-0x-protocol-86779ae5809e", "author": "willwarren89", "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/87juxd/governance_in_0x_protocol/"}, "87jvs9": {"id": "87jvs9", "subreddit": "r/ethtrader", "created_utc": 1522168688.0, "title": "TPL \u2014 A Framework for Secure KYC/AML Compliant Peer-to-Peer Exchange Encoded Smart Contracts.", "text": "", "url": "https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/tpl-a-framework-for-secure-peer-to-peer-exchange-7c69fd0aebc9", "author": "maxmersch", "permalink": "/r/ethtrader/comments/87jvs9/tpl_a_framework_for_secure_kycaml_compliant/"}, "87jzcy": {"id": "87jzcy", "subreddit": "r/ethtrader", "created_utc": 1522169448.0, "title": "new crypto arbitrage service", "text": "", "url": "https://coinspread.org/", "author": "coinspread", "permalink": "/r/ethtrader/comments/87jzcy/new_crypto_arbitrage_service/"}, "87jcgd": {"id": "87jcgd", "subreddit": "r/ethtrader", "created_utc": 1522164808.0, "title": "STK joins the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance", "text": "", "url": "https://medium.com/@STKtoken/stk-joins-the-ethereum-enterprise-alliance-7f1adbd9f9a5", "author": "Nikhil9865", "permalink": "/r/ethtrader/comments/87jcgd/stk_joins_the_ethereum_enterprise_alliance/"}, "87j9e7": {"id": "87j9e7", "subreddit": "r/ethtrader", "created_utc": 1522164179.0, "title": "Funfair (FUN) new website and updated roadmap", "text": "", "url": "https://funfair.io/", "author": "IGVUK", "permalink": "/r/ethtrader/comments/87j9e7/funfair_fun_new_website_and_updated_roadmap/"}, "87jm5e": {"id": "87jm5e", "subreddit": "r/ethtrader", "created_utc": 1522166823.0, "title": "Streamr have 6+ new partners in the bag including fortune 500 companies", "text": "", "url": "https://twitter.com/streamrinc/status/978636406296891392?s=19", "author": "Jackykoh", "permalink": "/r/ethtrader/comments/87jm5e/streamr_have_6_new_partners_in_the_bag_including/"}, "87jfal": {"id": "87jfal", "subreddit": "r/ethtrader", "created_utc": 1522165414.0, "title": "Ethereum meets Japan.

Here are the details:\n\n* **Posting is nearly free & instant.** (Technobabble: uses a stateless contract, IPFS, and batched transactions.)\n\n* **Prove it's you.** Prove ownership of social media accounts via an oracle contract (just Twitter for now).\n\n* **Practical.** Automatically repost to Twitter, get email notifications, use on mobile via Toshi/Cipher/Trust, & more.\n\n\n**Why does this matter?** It's a decentralized and incorruptible alternative to Twitter that's accessible to non-crypto enthusiasts.\n\n\n**Where's it going?** Peepeth could be one of the first widely-used dApps. I plan to add more features, build a mobile app, get a redesign, & make peepeth.org to help others build front-ends.\n\n\n**Revenue model** Peepeth has a public back-end (blockchain+ipfs) and a private front-end (peepeth.com). Currently, the revenue model is charging for social media verification, and taking a percentage of tips. I'm also offering \"Founder\" badges for a short time (donations).\n\n\n**Want to help? Here are a few ways:**\n\n* **Seed Peepeth with great content.** Let's give decentralized social media a good name. \n\n* **Whales only: buy a Founder badge.** I could use your help to make Peepeth mainstream. If Peepeth does get adopted beyond the crypto community, it could help the ecosystem. See peepeth.com/support\n\n* **Offer your advice and suggestions.** Peepeth is a compilation of other peoples' ideas, so please feel free to contribute your strategic and tactical insights.\n\n* **Share with friends & the media.** Especially interested in reaching tech-savvy people outside of crypto.\n\nAs it stands, to sign up you first have to request an invite on the site, and I'll approve them on a rolling basis as I work out potential teething issues.\n\nAll feedback appreciated.\n\nThanks to all who've helped make Peepeth possible!\n\nBevan Barton", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/87k9iz/presenting_peepeth_a_decentralized_alternative_to/", "author": "madame_BOV", "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/87k9iz/presenting_peepeth_a_decentralized_alternative_to/"}, "87kabd": {"id": "87kabd", "subreddit": "r/ethereum", "created_utc": 1522171473.0, "title": "Kees de Vos, CEO of MobileBridge, discusses the importance of Capturing \u2018value\u2019 in Marketing", "text": "", "url": "https://medium.com/@keesdevosNL/capturing-value-in-marketing-358de4244f63", "author": "shon_film", "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/87kabd/kees_de_vos_ceo_of_mobilebridge_discusses_the/"}, "87kf6m": {"id": "87kf6m", "subreddit": "r/ethtrader", "created_utc": 1522172445.0, "title": "Medichain Tokens Represent Health Ecosystem Through Blockchain Technology", "text": "Medichain utilize EMR data of a patient to be utilized in health ecosystem specially for insurance company, health researcher, pharmacy industries, etc. MediChain Utility Tokens (MCU) represent the value of arbitrary patient data blocks.
