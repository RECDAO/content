Digitize is targeting the public and consumer directly by solving a real world problem. Most cryptocurrencies today are tech heavy and hard to understand for the average consumer - a barrier for the mainstream adoption of the technology. We plan to solve this by developing a service that helps consumers convert loose change to crypto and remove the frustration of carrying and saving loose change entirely. By making this process a simple and seamless experience we can help bring the public into the crypto world one coin at a time. The Digitize ecosystem will prevent the need to carry loose-change and promote the transition from a cash based society to a digital based society. Reductions in the manufacturing of physical currency will be noticeable, as well as reducing the amount of change lost by consumers.

However recently I spent a few weeks with my parity offline, and then upon trying to resume syncing with the blockchain, no matter what I try, I cannot get it to sync. This is a somewhat large issue for me as I want to be able to access my erc20 tokens, and without being synced I cannot move them to where they need to be.\n\nI am using parity 1.8.6. I have never had issues in the past with parity. I have a good internet connection and a standard 1TB HDD (non ssd). I have plenty of ram etc also.\n\nWhen i start parity it tries to warp restore but inevitably fails or becomes stuck, and then when i check the current block number it IS increasing, but at a rate so slow (a block every few seconds) that I will never be able to catch up with the live blockchain. \n\nI have left my computer on for stretches of 48hrs+, and am always still far far behind where I need to be in block numbers. I have tried parity --db kill and had the data base succesfully deleted. I have also deleted the nodes.json file (while parity is closed) in an attempt to clear everything and get a fresh start, however nothing has worked *yet*.\n\nIs there a better version of parity that I can upgrade to? Is changing my cache size a good idea, and if so how do i do that? \n\nI know that my tokens are safe as i can check them on etherscan, but it is *extremely* frustrating not being able to move them to where I need them, due to parity being unable to sync. It feels like I am locked out of access to my own funds, which is part of the reason I became interested in cryptocurrencies in the first place. \n\n\nAs a final note, I know that I could use MEW to access my funds, but for now I would much rather learn how to get my parity working again. \n\nThanks heaps for taking the time to read all this <3 much love to you all.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/869z25/parity_version_that_makes_syncing_easiest/", "author": "TheMooJuice", "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/869z25/parity_version_that_makes_syncing_easiest/"}, "869zhg": {"id": "869zhg", "subreddit": "r/ethtrader", "created_utc": 1521707730.0, "title": "Which Mobile Apps do you use to trade?", "text": "I've only used the desktop/web version of exchanges, and sometimes I find myself wanting to trade on the go.

Meet CEDEX.", "text": "Thanks to CEDEX a blockchain-based diamond exchange, for the first time, general investors could have the opportunity to confidently invest in diamonds as they would in other traditional assets.\n\nThe last ten years have seen numerous attempts to create a lucrative diamond market for the general investment community, yet up to now, none of them has been able to overcome all the challenges facing such an endeavor, including the problems of the diamond industry\u2019s lack of transparency, liquidity and standardization. CEDEX looks to have found a solution to all three as it creates the first ever blockchain based certified diamond exchange, powered by its own cryptocurrency, the CEDEX Coin. Actually this will not be a coin but a ERC20 token on Ethereum blockchain.\n\nCEDEX aims to turn diamonds into a tradable financial asset, overcoming the industry\u2019s lack of liquidity and transparency. Thanks to smart contracts and that each transaction is published on the blockchain, investors are no longer faced with closed diamond industry of old where markups were an inevitable reality for non-diamond professionals and it was almost impossible to resell a stone without a loss. \n\nCEDEX\u2019s algorithm, the DEX, accurately and transparently evaluates each diamond based on three main elements of each diamond: \n-on parallel composite data, \n-gemological information, \n-and diamond indices composite data.\n\nCEDEX generates diamond smart contracts that represent the ownership of each stone, historical trading data and gem composite. To buy and/or sell diamonds on the exchange, investors will use the CEDEX Coin, the platform\u2019s native digital currency, required for all transactions.\n\n CEDEX establishes new standards for transparency and trustlessness factors in the diamond market, showing the benefits that are possible for tokenization of additional real-world assets like stock, real estate, and other commodities.\n\nLearn more about the CEDEX coin o its [website] (https://cedex.com/)\n\nand from its [Lightpaper] (https://cedex.com/img/LIGHTPAPER.pdf) and [Whitepaper] (https://cedex.com/img/Whitepaper.pdf)\n\nAs of today CEDEX sold more than 26 mln tokens valued more than $20 mln so we could say with confidence that in the nearest future maybe this year we`ll see the launch of first Diamond-Trading Marketplace On The Blockchain.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/86endb/buy_and_sell_diamonds_with_tokens_meet_cedex/", "author": "Artedoc", "permalink": "/r/ethtrader/comments/86endb/buy_and_sell_diamonds_with_tokens_meet_cedex/"}, "86eoe2": {"id": "86eoe2", "subreddit": "r/ethereum", "created_utc": 1521749737.0, "title": "Coinbase Glitch Allowed Unlimited ETH Balances - Bitcoin News", "text": "", "url": "https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-glitch-allowed-unlimited-ethereum-balances/", "author": "cryptodmoney", "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/86eoe2/coinbase_glitch_allowed_unlimited_eth_balances/"}, "86erdc": {"id": "86erdc", "subreddit": "r/ethereum", "created_utc": 1521750370.0, "title": "ethereumjs-devp2p v2.5.0 - Stable ETH connection and LES/2 light client protocol", "text": "We have gone through quite some updates for our javascript devp2p implementation recently I'd like to share today.\n\nVersions v2.3.0 and v2.4.0 - already released a couple of weeks ago fixed various critical bugs and now also allow for connections with Parity clients and for the first time provide a really reliable ETH connection getting to sync the first block/transaction data within 1-2 minutes.\n\nThe now released version v2.5.0 finally introduces light client protocol LES/2 support, see https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-devp2p/releases for detailed release notes.\n\nTo see both protocols in action, run the examples described in the repository README.\n\nThere is still some way to go with one bigger task for the future being the implementation of the discovery v5 protocol.

There's one other competitor I was able to find, that just arrived on the scene. Relex however has first mover advantage, bigger partnerships/reach, and is already a functioning company/platform, with services being provided right now. \n\nRelex is a blockchain based funding vehicle creation of the parent company **Squawk Advisors Inc**. Squawk Advisors has an FDI development portfolio across multiple countries, all over the world. The Squawk group of companies has been contracting with FDI projects since 2014, and this in Fall 2017, they decided to initiate bringing their offerings onto the blockchain.\n\nRLX investors have the opportunity to invest in projects during the development phase, which results in exciting opportunities such as proxy ownership of resorts, shopping malls, offices, and more. RLX also provides more rights as a proxy developer, like having your voice heard regarding design, and implementation of the final master plan.\n\nThe projects that RLX partners with, agree to fund their development projects exclusively on the Relex blockchain. I'll list some pertinent points below, to avoid this post being too long.\n\n\u25fc Peter Lee, former VP at JP Morgan was recently appointed Director of the Relex project.\n\n\u25fc They are partnered with Woodfine Capital Projects, an asset management company that has been around for 30 years, and their CEO Peter Woodfine has development experience working with large corporates, such as Walmart, Costco, and others. Relex negotiated a 10% commission from Woodfine Capital Projects, and redistributes the commissions in the form of **investor discounts** for Relex (RLX) holders. \n\n\u25fc The first blockchain-based real estate asset to be listed on the NYSE.\n\n\u25fc Based in Chicago, and just opened a new office in New Jersey.\n\n\u25fc Claim to be the world's only crypto asset to be indexed with the SEC's registration system, & issued a CIK for regulation and compliance purposes(they are registered via the parent company Squawk Advisors).\n\n\u25fc Recently announced, they will be expanding the Relex platform into the health sector, partnering with **Aura** \"inhalable health supplements\". They will develop and expand the first inhalable pharmaceutical and supplement R&D to be funded by blockchain and cryptocurrency.\nAura CFO Peter Alcure has worked with Squawk Advisors since 2015.\n\n\u25fc Aura's existing inahable range sold in the U.S. includes energy, focus, memory, sleep, and anti-hangover supplements. And **Viagra** \n\n( \u0361\u00ba \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00ba).\n\n\u25fc Relex will launch a new token for its health division to fund this venture, and holders of the original RLX, geared toward real estate development, will be rewarded the new token 1:1.\n\n\u25fc Aura's chief scientist was the first to discover and patent the technology of inhalable Vitamin B and has gone on to develop an array of inhalable supplements and pharmaceuticals.\n\n\u25fc They have a strong focus on FINRA and SEC compliance. SEC is taken care of, and they are working on regulatory approval, for \"crowdfunded ownership\" on their real estate platform.\n\n                                       Project details\n\nTotal RLX supply: **2 Billion**\n\nCurrent Marketcap: **$1.9M**\n\nTrading on: **ForkDelta - https://forkdelta.github.io/#!/trade/RLX-ETH  and Stocks.exchange - https://stocks.exchange/trade/RLX/ETH**\n\nCurrent price: **$.000979/0.00000119 ETH**\n\nCirculating is N/A currently\n\nRead HOW the token will be utilized via their website, as it's lengthy.\n\n                                        Links\n\n**Websites:**\n \nhttps://relex.io/\n\nhttps://www.woodfine.co/\n\nhttp://aurainhale.com/\n\n**Twitter:**\n \nhttps://twitter.com/relextalk?lang=en\n\n**Facebook:**\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/RelexTalk/\n\n**Bitcointalk ANN:**\n\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2075473.0\n\nWhew! I know that was a ton, and I apologize about the length, just felt compelled to share(shill) this with others, as it's quite under the radar currently. They have a website redesign coming soon, and also are set to begin a marketing campaign.
