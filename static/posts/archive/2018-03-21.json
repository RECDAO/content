There are so many similar projects without any use cases, or potential real users.\n* Most coins aim to solve the same problems and focus on the same broad use cases.\n* A large number of projects claim to be \"better, faster, bigger, etc.\" yet fail to provide any sustainable competitive advantage\n* With a few exceptions, the vast majority of blockchain platforms (Smart contracts and dApps) don't offer clear significant benefits against the established players. In addition, they don\u2019t provide services that would help attract new users, e.g. helping them integrate users\u2019 products into the platform, and they don\u2019t suggest any other ways of how they will attract a critical number of users. This will likely result in a large number of zombie platforms serving small numbers of companies.\n* Similarly, only top3, maybe top5 projects within each category should dominate, while the rest would struggle to attract users or cease to exist, unless they pivot to focus on specific small niches within their markets\n* Many projects fail to clearly communicate what they actually do and why they exist, i.e. what are their benefits against competition. In some cases, we needed to really go deep into their whitepapers or even discussion boards to understand what they actually do.\n* In cases when a project aims to solve a specific problem, it seems to have much lower market cap potential compared to crypto projects that are impossible to link to traditional companies or industries\n* Top 3 categories of the reviewed projects: Finance (29%), Digital cash (21%), Smart contracts and dApps (16%)\n\n\n\n\n**Categories** ([check the 300+ crypto map](https://matchcoins.info/300-crypto-map-matchcoins-info.pdf))\n\nCategories are available on MatchCoins.info, currently as a feature of coin comparison.

But consider this;  with 85% of the total world population utilising energy in some form, and our technical and consumer demands increasing, there is plenty of scope of more Blockchain Energy companies to enter the market and succeed.  \n  \nThere are already two well-known offerings in the market. **Power Ledger** is building a trading platform allowing consumers to buy and sell their energy to peers in a trustless\nenvironment. **WePower** is something of a platform, allowing renewable energy providers to\nessentially launch \u2018ICOs\u2019 of sort on the network in return for tokenising their future energy\nproduction at a discount.  \n  \nSitting somewhere in the middle of this model, with some features all its own, is Restart Energy.\nReasonably fresh out of ICO, Restart issued 400,000,000 RED MWAT TOKENS for a $40M raise ($0.10 per token), which were snapped up in a hurry. With a total final supply of 500,000,000 tokens, this represented a generous public share and reasonable fundraising goal.  \n  \n*So what is Restart Energy trying to achieve, and what value is there to holding RED MWAT Tokens?*  \n  \nRestart Energy is focused in a few core areas. Firstly, and somewhat similar to Power Ledger, it is at its core a decentralised P2P trading platform \u2013 utilising a blockchain platform called RED. Token holders can use the token to access the platform and buy/sell energy directly from providers cutting out the middleman and leading to an estimated reduction of 30% in energy costs. Or they can hold the coin and benefit from 0.11kWh of energy after the TGE (13.13kWh by 2023 if goals are met!)\nFurthermore, the platform itself allows frictionless peer to peer trading between all consumers and\nproducers. Like Power Ledger this should reduce the costs of energy purchasing and transferring for\nall, and reduce inefficiencies in energy supply by utilising frictionless peer to peer movement.\nWhere Restart Energy really shines, however, is with its franchising model. As WePower encourages businesses to launch renewable projects by launching ICOS of sorts to prefund their development, Restart encourages a model of franchising in new locations. Here, long term holding of tokens allows you to become a franchiser for RED energy when they expand. The reach of your franchise is directly tied to your holdings, as follows:  \n  \n* 10,000 Tokens - RED City Franchise - allows the token holder to broker energy sales in their city\nof residence  \n* 100,000 Tokens - RED Regional Franchise - allows the token holder to broker energy sales in an\nentire region of their country of residence  \n* 1,000,000 Tokens - Red Country Franchise - allows the token holder to broker energy sales in\ntheir entire country of residence  \n* +10,000,000 Tokens - RED Master Franchise - gives the token holder country exclusivity and the\noption to create sub-franchises inside their country of residence (starting from 10,000,000 Tokens\nup, dependent on population)  \n\nThis franchise can work in one of two ways:\n**Option A**  \n  \n*Franchise Owner of a Power Retail Company*  \n* Restart Energy would work together with the Master-Franchisee to help set-up his own\npower retail company, and the Master-Franchisee would be the one to enter into a new market and establish his business.  \n* The Master-Franchisee would take on all risk and expenses to create a market, and Restart Energy would provide technical, infrastructural, process automation, marketing and sales support.  \n* The MasterFranchisee would need to provide the financial and management capacity for\nsetting up a power retail company. Master Franchise owner would receive a full power retail business in a shell: Assistance for creation & operation of own power retail company, Right to use Restart Energy\u2019s brand and business model including software and franchise infrastructure, Control over revenues, Technical Training for all staff and employees, Marketing and Branding package, Country Promotion for the months leading up to and after launch, paid for by Restart Energy, in order to promote the RED ecosystem and franchise business, Access to Complete Energy Supply, CRM Software with 100% process automation, Access to Restart Energy specialized personnel and management to assist and fully support the franchise and its owners, Energy & gas trading, balancing and forecasting technical, support  \n\n**Pros**: Higher profits; ownership of power retail company; cross selling to existing customer database; high process automation to deal with large numbers of low volume consumers with high margins; unique selling points and ecosystem; flexible products and services  \n  \n\n**Cons**: Higher capital requirements; Franchisee takes the risk of expansion to new markets\n\n**Option B**  \n  \n*Reselling / Brokering*  \n  \nRestart Energy would be the one to enter into a new market and establish the company. The company would take on all risks and expenses to create a market, and the franchise owner would\nsimply act as a retailer or broker with our full support. Master Franchise owner would receive: Right to create and sell sub-franchises, Part of revenues from all sub-franchises, A comprehensive franchise kit - detailing all relevant information for the target market, modelled after already successful franchise kits provided to European partners of Restart. Training for all staff and employees, Marketing and Branding, Local Promotion for the months leading up\nto and after the launch, paid for by Restart Energy to promote the RED ecosystem and franchise business. Access to the Agent Module, offering the ability to add new franchises, see energy consumption and manage clients. Access to the Front Desk Module of RED CRM Access to Restart Energy management, from where Restart can assist and fully support the\nfranchise and its owners. As a reseller/broker, you would be entitled to a\npercentage of all revenues made by all other franchises in the target country (typically 10%), plus\nthe revenues generated from direct sales, in the form of signing premium plus passive consumption\ncommission.  \n  \n**Pros:** Very low risk, Restart Energy takes on cost of expansion  \n  \n**Cons:** Lower margin compared to full franchise ownership  \n  \n  \nWhat is really of note, however, is that this is far from an idea. Restart Energy have already applied\nthis model into a successful business in their home country of Romania. Reporting $5.45m revenue\nin 2016, they grew the company 400% in 2017 and expect to grow it 500% in 2018 to a forecasted\nrevenue of $100m. The company already serves 30,000 people in Romania, 27k households and 3k\nbusinesses or commercial properties, and have spread the franchise model to over 300 business\npartners in Romania.  \n  \n  \nThe team behind this project have already built and established the first energy retail franchise\nmodel and seen significant growth of their core business. Add to this an advisory board that\nincludes a member of European Parliament, as well as a host of energy, legal and blockchain\nexperts, and Restart Energy is well positioned to continue its vast rate of expansion.\nBy focusing its initial expansion around Eastern Europe, there shouldn\u2019t be any initial competition\nwith WePower, Power Ledger or ElectrifYAsia. As time goes on, the model of Restart is in my\nopinion better suited to encourage development of localised microgrids through its franchising\nmodel than WePower.  \n  \nAt the very least, if Restart Energy can continue its production goals, based on current average\nKW/H prices, the token would be worth over 39x current market price for the energy it purchased alone in 2022. (Per whitepaper expected value and based on current values)  \n  \n  \n  The cheap price (less than 50% ICO price) offers an opportunity to load up on a cheap long term\nhold. It would only cost $500 at the moment to obtain enough coins to become an average city\nfranchise holder, which could provide additional revenue in future. Even to meet the meagre goals\nof Wepower and Power Ledgers current market price, the value of the holding would have to go up\n3x and 11x accordingly. It may then represent a good opportunity for a low market cap gem that\nsees big growth in 2018 \u2013 particularly with the MVP launch of the platform due in April 2018.  \n  \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/86324s/restart_energy_fundamental_analysis/", "author": "reeceprocter89", "permalink": "/r/ethtrader/comments/86324s/restart_energy_fundamental_analysis/"}, "8633vh": {"id": "8633vh", "subreddit": "r/ethereum", "created_utc": 1521647198.0, "title": "Blockchain Miners Have Special Privileges We Don\u2019t \u2013 Weaponized Math", "text": "", "url": "https://medium.com/@alexsherbuck/blockchain-miners-have-special-privileges-we-dont-d05810434171", "author": "WeaponizedMath", "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/8633vh/blockchain_miners_have_special_privileges_we_dont/"}, "8637iy": {"id": "8637iy", "subreddit": "r/ethereum", "created_utc": 1521647962.0, "title": "Vinay Gupta and Rob Knight: Global governance in the era of blockchain.

After digging in, I am absolutely gobsmacked at the potential of this project and the people involved!\n\nI am going to share my research with you here and I think you will be impressed :)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Existing Business Model**\n\nIn a nutshell, ELECTRIFY works with electricity providers and regulators to create an online marketplace, giving customers access to more options and cheaper electricity.  Here is a summary from their whitepaper:\n\t\n>Founded by two senior executives from the Singaporean energy industry in early 2017, ELECTRIFY is the first retail electricity marketplace in Southeast-Asia addressing the need for transparency and security in the energy market. With a GMV of over SGD$5 million to date, ELECTRIFY has transacted more than 30GWh of electricity for business consumers since incorporation.\n\t\n&nbsp;\n\n**The Future of ELECTRIFY Using the Blockchain (and the ELEC token)**\n\nUsing the blockchain, the existing business model will be enhanced by eliminating middleman fees, reducing transaction cost, and automating electricity contract execution.\n\t\nIn this ehanced marketplace, an ELECTRIFY eWallet will be used with ELEC tokens as the currency. The ELEC token will be used in several ways, inluding reserve requirements for electricity producers, fees for transacations, and loyalty rewards to customers.\n\t\nThere are several very exciting aspects to their new marketplace, including their PowerPod product which is used to accurately track and audit the production from a small-scale energy producer.  This enables people to buy directly from one another in their new system!\n\t\nBe sure to check out the whitepaper, as it goes into great detail on all of this and more!\n\t\n&nbsp;\n\nWhitepaper - https://electrify.asia/whitepaper/\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Big Time Connections**\n\nAirdop + eWallet.  Does it ring any bells?  OMG!  Jun, the founder of Omise and OmiseGo is an advisor and investor in ELEC!  In fact, he has worked very closely with the ELEC team through the whole process.  \n\t\nIt should not come as a surprise then, that the ELECTRIFY eWallet will run on the OMG Network!  Here are a few pictures that really got my attention :)\n\t\n&nbsp;\n\nMartin Lim (ELECTRIFY COO):\n\nHanging out with Jun from OMG - https://imgur.com/a/60VHw\n\t\nChillin with Vitalik - https://imgur.com/a/VAR0D\n\t\t\n&nbsp;\n\n**ICO Terms**\n\nThe ICO was one of the smoothest I have ever seen.  They raised 20 million in the pre-sale (no bonus).  Investments over 300k have 50% locked for 3 months.  They raised an additional 10 million in the public ICO, with an individual cap of around 5 ETH.\n\t\nThey had a very large KYC whitelist for the pre-sale and many of those whitelisted did not gain access because of the 20 million cap.  Overall they sold 50% of the total token supply for 30 million USD.  \n\t\nETH was pegged at a fixed rate, so EVERYONE, including pre-sale investors paid the same price of $0.08usd / 0.0000851eth.\n\t\t\n&nbsp;\t\n\n**Potential**\n\nHere is where things really get exciting!  The current market cap is ~19 million and the price of the ELEC token is around $0.07 (lower than ICO in USD).   This is quite literally peanuts.   \n\t\nIMO, the only reason it is at the current price is because of the crazy bear market and the fact that this token is pretty much unknown.\n\t\nCurrently the token can be purchased on:\n\nIDEX - https://idex.market/eth/elec\n\nKucoin - https://www.kucoin.com/#/trade/ELEC-ETH\t\n\t\t\n&nbsp;\n\n**Summary**\n\nELEC is a token formed from an existing business in a rapidly expanding market.  The team is backed by some of the biggest names in crypto and the sky could really be the limit here.\n\t\nIn the short term you could see some very nice returns with this one.
