Specifically, it plots the closing price of the current day vs the highest price achieved any day prior using data from Cryptocompare. Here are some charts for ETH vs USD and ETH vs BTC: [ATH Comparison](https://imgur.com/a/sz1ix) that are pushing me to deposit some USD to buy ETH at its current price. \n\nHow the chart works is that it has the date on the x-axis and the equation (Close Price @ today's date)/(All Time High as of yesterday's date) as the y-axis value. So, for example, if the previous ATH price as of Jan 1 was $100 but on Jan 2 we reach $150 (new ATH) and close at $120, the chart would show a value of 120% for Jan 2 ($120/$100). Then, if on Jan 3 we close back at $100, the new value for Jan 3 will be 66.7% ($100/$150). This calculation is what I think makes the most sense but please comment if you think it would be better a different way.\n\nThe goal of this plot is to see if there are repeating percentages where peaks or troughs occur as these may be useful numbers to keep in mind when setting buy/sell orders (as useful as any trend analysis in crypto can be, that is). In addition, using percentages lets us compare data on a wider time frame as we can look at multiple run-up & correction cycles where the price of Ether differs by orders of magnitude and still analyze them all on the same scale. \n\nFor instance, Ether vs USD shows that over the past two years, the correction after a major run-up has dropped down to ~35% before nearing the ATHs again. This is right about where we are now (500/1400 = 35.7%) so it seems like we should be nearing the point (at least historically) where the sell-off stops if we can believe that there is a public sentiment that ~30-35% of ATH, regardless of ATH price, is the point at which the discount is too good to ignore. For ETH vs BTC, however, it is less clear since we are not at the bottom of the ratio (~20% in Dec 2016 and Dec 2017) but have been trending downwards and we haven't had an ATH since last June -- for me, I am not converting BTC --> ETH unless we drop down to ~20% of ATH but I am also not going to convert ETH --> BTC as I am optimistic that the team will deliver on the scaling initiatives. So, for my money, as I am in the market to acquire more ETH I will be trying to scrounge up some fiat to spend instead of converting my BTC into ETH. \n\nMostly just posting to prompt some discussion and see what people think about this plot/comparison and whether or not there are ideas about other comparisons or data analysis which may be useful. Overall, we are still within the bounds of a \"typical\" correction but if the price dropped to say $400 that would be a more significant drop relative to the ATH price than we had seen in 2+ years (around Q4 2015 it was as low as 25%). \n\n\nIf anyone is interested in checking out the site so that you can make this plot for other coins, send me a PM and I will send you the link. \n\nEdit: Site is [Cryptophan.net](https://cryptophan.net) if you want to check it out and make your own charts. As I said, I am just learning web development so I am certain there are still some bugs, particularly when viewing less popular coins (some are only recently available on cryptocompare's database).

What is the vision", "text": "**WHY DIGITIZE?**\n\nDigitize was founded through two frustrations:\n\n1) Carrying loose change.\n\n2) Difficulty in purchasing cryptocurrencies.\n\nLet\u2019s focus on the first point to begin. Frustration of carrying loose change. Let\u2019s face it, no one likes loose change! Whether it\u2019s crammed in your wallet or moving and jingling around in your pockets, loose change is a burden that everyone has to deal with because it\u2019s valuable and throwing it away doesn't make cents or sense. Digitize will solve this problem by letting you save your change at the point of sale, straight into your own digital wallet. The main goal here is to cater for the general public. We are specifically catering for the public who know nothing about crypto. We believe we can help them into our platform by providing a 'digital piggy bank'. Once we have these users onboard saving their change digitally, we can educate them about cryptocurrencies and the benefits, hence building trust with the technology and enabling mainstream adoption.\n\nThe second point focus\u2019 on the difficulty in purchasing cryptocurrencies. The majority of the public still views cryptocurrencies as a nightmare to purchase - especially given the technicalities involved. Digitize will make this process as simple and seamless as using cash through registered retailers. Further, with the recent bans of credit card and debit payments worldwide, there is an even greater need for a cash based purchase platform.\n\n**Digitize Coin Vision**\n\nProvide the public ways to convert loose change and spare cash into cryptocurrency. Our team believes this will create mainstream adoption. If you\u2019re thinking, \u201cAhhh, who uses money for purchases anymore?\u201d or \u201cThe world runs on plastic\u201d, have a look at these stats.\n\nAustralians toss $39 million in loose change each month. Americans throw away $62 million (USD) in coins each year. Brittons have 1.1 billion (GBP) in loose change. Airline passengers lost $675,000 USD at Los Angeles and San Francisco International Airports alone. And if you\u2019re still thinking cash isn\u2019t used anymore to facilitate loose change, consider that today, worldwide, two billion adults remain without a bank account. This is just under a quarter of the world\u2019s population. This means they\u2019re only using one thing. Cash. And do you want to know how many use mobile phones? Six billion. We have a nice amount of work ahead of us. We hope that you\u2019ll join our team and introduce cryptocurrency to the world, no matter how small those corners may be.\n\nFor more information on the Digitize platform, visit www.digitizecoin.com", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/87652f/digitize_coin_vision_why_digitize_what_is_the/", "author": "nhungtruong379", "permalink": "/r/ethtrader/comments/87652f/digitize_coin_vision_why_digitize_what_is_the/"}, "877r94": {"id": "877r94", "subreddit": "r/ethtrader", "created_utc": 1522055756.0, "title": "Get the information about the ICO's through Telegram Group", "text": "Telegram is an instant messaging service that has emerged as the go-to medium of communication between blockchain project teams and community members or potential investors.

This is a smart contract and website where Ethereum users can pledge to donate a certain amount to an address (ideally a charity of some sort), which gets sent only if others match that amount. Upon creating a pledge to donate a certain amount to some address, the user sends that Ether to the EthPledge smart contract, and if others donate to that pledge too up to that amount of Ether it all gets sent to the charity address. You can also pledge to donate several times what others do (eg. you could put up 10 Ether, and say that if others donate only 2 Ether it'll all get sent to the charity address).\n\nIt is fairly common for companies to do giving pledges like this (\"we'll match anything employees donate to this charity\") and having something like this on the Ethereum blockchain makes it 100% transparent and by going through a smart contract can guarantee someone holds up their end of the bargain. There is at least one major international charity with an Ethereum address for donations, Heifer International (https://www.heifer.org/what-you-can-do/give/digital-currency.html) and I've created the first pledge on the website to donate 0.1 Ether to them: see http://www.ethpledge.com/id/0 :) (look at it while connected to the mainnet).\n\nShould you create a pledge and then cancel it, you'll get a refund of your pledge amount in line with how much others have donated - if you cancel the pledge when 10% of the donation target has been reached, for example, 10% of your pledge amount (along with the donations) will be sent to the charity address, and 90% of the pledge amount you put up will be returned to you.\n\nThe verified contract code is at https://etherscan.io/address/0x10ec03b714a2660581040c1a0329d88e381ca603 and I've also uploaded the code for the website/UI at https://github.com/wanshun123/EthPledge if that's of interest to anyone.\n\nFeedback and criticism very much welcome.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/878tsm/ethpledge_smart_contract_for_matching_charity/", "author": "hanyuqn", "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/878tsm/ethpledge_smart_contract_for_matching_charity/"}, "878uy8": {"id": "878uy8", "subreddit": "r/ethtrader", "created_utc": 1522068801.0, "title": "When is the Crypto community going to Grow up, Wake up , Man up", "text": "Every time theres a little news story concerning crypto a sudden dumping follows.

We\u2019re not looking to advertise our product, but rather trying to get some input from the community. This is why we won\u2019t mention any details about the name of the company.\n\nBasically, we\u2019re developing a cryptocurrency data platform so you can keep up with this ever changing field. \n\nIt would consist of a feed displaying latest news about various coins (and possibly ICOs). This is the news feed part. Each coin would have its own profile that you can click on (basically this looks something like Facebook for coins).\n\nUser would be also be able to get a detailed view of currency\u2019s profile which would display technical information (f.e price, growth, etc.), sentiment analysis and other data obtained through data mining, latest tweets news and Reddit posts etc. So far we\u2019ve included relevant Twitter account and keywords as information source but we\u2019ve planned on including Youtube videos, Reddit and potentially some news sites.\n\nIt would be tailored to user\u2019s preferences and interests and would facilitate decision-making when it comes to investing in and trading with cryptocurrencies. Also it could offer you news even if you are not trading-oriented person but are interested in crypto world. \n\nThis is where we need your input. What would you expect from such a site? What other features, data sources or other things would you like it to include? What do you consider would make your work with cryptocurrencies easier?\n\nWe would greatly appreciate any ideas you might have, since we are making this for the community and not ourselves.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/87ctiw/cryptorelated_news_and_info/", "author": "__tms", "permalink": "/r/ethtrader/comments/87ctiw/cryptorelated_news_and_info/"}, "87cvrh": {"id": "87cvrh", "subreddit": "r/ethtrader", "created_utc": 1522099656.0, "title": "Instead of HODLing...", "text": "it makes more sense to play the game, at least to me.\n\nI can understand that people are nervous about the thought of selling and missing out on gains in the event of a sudden increase and I can understand that there is a certain tranquility in the thought that whatever you are holding is safe and can't be touched. \n\nWhat I understand slightly less are those who see the entire market dropping around them and decide that HODLing is definitely the right way to go without even reconsidering their position. Most will argue that HODLing and doing nothing outperforms day trading, in traditional investment vehicles. But which current traditional investments can lose 20% of their total portfolio value within half a day on a regular basis? the two can't be compared in terms of strategy in that regard.\n\nIf you know the price is currently dropping and looks likely to drop, why don't you sell back into your chosen currency? regardless of whether you bought in at a higher price or even at the same price; at a certain point this is damage limitation and if the value continues to drop, there's nothing to prevent buying back in once after some deliberation, either perhaps covering the losses you incurred by selling and regaining some of what you initially held back, or you have some spare cash left.\n\nJust because the prices increase and decrease at a faster rate and things seem to change perpetually, I don't tend to think that automatically means that decisions need to be made quicker also. Sometimes taking a step back and reassessing what is happening is the best option; even if a small loss is incurred. \n\nThis is really just in response to those criticising those who sell at these levels and can't seem to fathom why it may not be as impulsive as it appears on the surface.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/87cvrh/instead_of_hodling/", "author": "Ashadyfellow", "permalink": "/r/ethtrader/comments/87cvrh/instead_of_hodling/"}, "87cxo2": {"id": "87cxo2", "subreddit": "r/ethereum", "created_utc": 1522100095.0, "title": "Coinbase Will Add Support For Certain ERC20 Tokens", "text": "", "url": "https://usethebitcoin.com/coinbase-will-add-support-for-certain-erc20-tokens/", "author": "andix3", "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/87cxo2/coinbase_will_add_support_for_certain_erc20_tokens/"}, "87czqe": {"id": "87czqe", "subreddit": "r/ethtrader", "created_utc": 1522100564.0, "title": "Lost 7500 since December, wondering if I should hodl?", "text": "As the title suggests, I bought 15k in December at 860 a coin, as everyone knows it's hovering 450 today.\n\nI've already made peace with losing the entire 15k investment if things get even more sour, just wondering what the communities thoughts are? Do people have confidence it will bounce back by this December or sooner?\n\nEDIT:\nTo speak on some of the toxic comments on this thread. Crypto, just like FIAT, is only as powerful as the people give it power. Telling rando's to \"sell off\" and a general toxic attitude won't help new comers or ETH as a whole, in any way.
